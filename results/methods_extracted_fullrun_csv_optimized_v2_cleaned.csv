In the implementation used for the field deployments, each ISCA consisted of an array of 5×5 wells. Each well was 6.8 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth, which corresponds to ~110 µl of fluid (Supplementary Fig. 1), a volume selected based on the estimated lower limit of input required for DNA extraction and sequencing. The wells were spaced 17 mm apart between rows (centre to centre) and 9 mm within a row (Supplementary Fig. 1). The port of each well was offset from the centre of the well to allow release of air bubbles during filling of the well (Supplementary Fig. 1). Considering a representative diffusion coefficient D of 1×10-9 m2 s-1, the estimated distance L a solute travels in a time t= 1 h is L = √4Dt = 3.8 mm. The spacing used therefore ensures no well-to-well interaction of the chemical plumes within typical deployment times of 1 h. The port diameter was 800 µm with a depth of 1.6 mm (Supplementary Fig. 1). A high aspect ratio for the inlet port was selected to diminish the effects of cavity flow on device performance (Supplementary Note 1). Each mould was filled with 26 g of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; 10:1 PDMS base to curing agent, wt/wt; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning). Curing was carried out overnight at 40 °C (the deflection point of VeroGrey is 48 °C). The cured PDMS slab (95 mm x 65 mm × 4.6 mm) was cut using a razor blade and carefully peeled from the mould. The PDMS blocks were inspected and any port obstructions cleared using a biopsy punch of the appropriate diameter (ProSciTech). Finally, the devices were UV-sterilized and plasma-bonded to sterile glass microscope slides (100mm×76mm×1mm, VWR) by exposing both to oxygen plasma for 5 min using a plasma cleaner/sterilizer (Harrick Scientific). Following bonding, the ISCA was heated at 90°C for 10 min to accelerate the formation of covalent bonds and then stored at room temperature until use.",1

The marine bacterium V. coralliilyticus (YB2) was used as a model organism for laboratory experiments due to its high level of motility and strong chemotactic response13. A glycerol stock of V. coralliilyticus was streaked onto Difco 2216 Marine Broth (BD Biosciences) agar plates containing 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin (Axonlab). Individual colonies were then removed and grown in 1% (vol/vol) 2216 Marine Broth in 0.22-µm-filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) for 22h (ref. 13). The cultures were then diluted 1/20 (vol/vol) in 0.22-um-filtered Instant Ocean to obtain the bacterial suspension used in the experiments. All cells were grown at 30°C and 180 r.p.m. To ensure that bacteria found in the ISCA well had entered via chemotaxis and not by flushing due to fluid flow or Brownian motion, we carried out an experiment with non-motile bacteria. We used M. adhaerens (HP15 AfliC), a non-motile mutant lacking fliC, a gene necessary for flagellar synthesis23. A glycerol stock of M. adhaerens HP15 AfliC was streaked onto Difco 2216 Marine Broth agar plates containing 50 µg ml-1 ampicillin (Axonlab). Individual colonies were then suspended in 10% 2216 Marine Broth for 1 day.

Seymour and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Assembly of the integrated ISCA for laboratory experiments and chemotaxis experiments with isolates,"To visualize chemotactic accumulations in the ISCA wells without interference by external fluid flows, a modified version of the ISCA was integrated into a microcosm designed for use on an inverted microscope. To achieve this, an ISCA was prepared in the same manner as described above, but only four of the wells were excised from the PDMS block to reduce the footprint of the device (Supplementary Fig. 1). The four wells were plasma-bonded to the centre of a microscope slide (75 mm×50mm×1mm) and a four-walled PDMS enclosure was plasma-bonded around the wells (Supplementary Fig. 1). The design of the mould used to generate the enclosure is provided in Supplementary File 1. This ISCA-containing microcosm was placed onto the stage of an inverted microscope (Eclipse Ti-E, Nikon). A well of the integrated ISCA was filled with the prepared bacterial suspension and three stacks of images (80 µm step size, 2,960 µm total) were acquired within this well to calculate the bacterial concentration throughout the microcosm. This bacterial concentration (Co) was subsequently used to normalize the concentration measured in individual treatments, so that chemotactic accumulations were quantified relative to the absolute concentration of bacteria present in each experiment. The device was then removed from the microscope stage and one well of the device was filled with a chemoattractant (10% Marine Broth for experiments with V. coralliilyticus; 100 μΜ α-methylaspartate for experiments with E. coli; Supplementary Figs. 3 and 6), while a second well was filled with filtered artificial seawater (FASW) for experiments with M. adhaerens and V. coralliilyticus or with motility medium for experiments with E. coli, both serving as negative controls (Supplementary Figs. 4 and 7). After placing the microcosm back on the microscope stage, an initial image stack was acquired (80 μ m step size, 2,960 µm total; time t=0). The microcosm was then filled with the bacterial suspension and one image stack was acquired every minute for 60 min (Supplementary Fig. 2). Image stacks acquired within the wells consisted of one image for every 80 µm of depth, throughout the depth (2,960 µm) of the well. Image acquisition was carried out with a 20x objective using Nikon Elements software and a Zyla 4.2 PLUS SCMOS camera (Andor).",1

Seymour and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Image analysis,"To quantify cells in our laboratory experiments it was necessary to accurately identify cells in each image, while excluding out-of-focus cells and debris. To accomplish this, image processing and analysis were carried out in MATLAB 2015a (MathWorks) using the Image Processing Toolbox. The image stacks obtained in Nikon Elements were first filtered with a bandpass Gaussian filter to reduce high-frequency noise and remove larger objects due to uneven illumination or out-of-focus halos. The processed images were then segmented to identify candidate bacteria. These candidates were subsequently gated based on average pixel intensity and object area to enumerate the cells in each image. The resulting cell counts were manually verified for a subset of images in each image stack. Videos demonstrating the success of the image analysis in identifying cells are provided in Supplementary Videos 5-7. The analysis was successful in identifying the majority of cells while excluding out-of-focus cells. To determine absolute cell concentrations it was necessary to quantify the depth of field for each of the three strains of bacteria used, so that the cell concentration could be computed from the number of cells and the imaging volume. The detection of cells described above depends on the choice of gating parameters and the fluorescent intensity of the cells themselves. The depth of field was determined empirically by analysis of vertical image stacks of fluorescently labelled cells on a horizontal surface. The image processing described above was carried out and the depth of field was defined as twice the height at which the number of detected in-focus cells was <10% of the value at the surface. This depth of field was then used consistently throughout the analysis to determine cell concentrations. The cell concentration in each well (C) was normalized by the cell concentration in the initial bacterial suspension (Co) measured in a well filled with that suspension.",1

Seymour and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Field deployments,"Field deployments took place in April 2016 at Clovelly Beach (33.91°S, 151.26°E), located on the eastern coast of Australia. To ensure the initial absence of microbial cells in the seawater used as both a negative control and as a base for chemoattractant suspensions, seawater from the site was subjected to a triple-filtration process, where 50 ml was collected and first filtered through a 0.2 µm Sterivex filter (Millipore), followed by a 0.2 µm Millex FG (Millipore) and finally through a 0.02 µm Anotop filter (Whatman). Five 80 µl samples of this ultrafiltered seawater were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for subsequent flow cytometry analysis, which confirmed the effectiveness of this filtration protocol in removing all bacterial cells. For initial testing of the ISCA in the field we used a broad-spectrum chemoattractant, Marine Broth 2216 (Beckton Dickson), a common growth medium for marine microorganisms. A 10% final concentration of Marine Broth was resuspended in freshly ultrafiltered seawater from the deployment site immediately before loading in the ISCA wells. The ISCA wells were filled with the port facing up: sterile 1 ml syringes and 27G needles (Terumo) were used to load samples into the wells. The diameter of the needle being smaller than the port allowed air to escape as the well was filled. This procedure was found to be optimal in ensuring complete filling, with no residual air bubbles in the wells. Across each ISCA, treatments (filtered seawater or Marine Broth) were randomly allocated to an ISCA row (consisting of five wells). All wells in a row acted as technical replicates and four different ISCAs were deployed in parallel to act as biological replicates. Each ISCA was secured inside a deployment enclosure (Supplementary Fig. 10), which was sealed by pressure-sensitive tape (Scotch, 3M) and an enclosure plug to seal the bottom drain (Supplementary Fig. 11). Each enclosure was then attached to a modified vice enabling the deployed ISCA to be firmly secured to a rigid structure (for example, pontoon, ladder or pole) to minimize enclosure movement and standardize the deployment depth at 1 m. As the enclosures were submerged, they slowly filled with seawater through the enclosure inlets. Once completely filled with seawater, the enclosure inlets were plugged (to seal the enclosure) and the ISCAs were left in situ for 1 h. Upon retrieval of the enclosures, the side outlets were unsealed progressively to slowly drain the seawater. Once the enclosures were completely empty, the contents of ISCA wells were then collected using 1 ml syringes and 27G needles (Terumo), with the ports facing down. For each ISCA, the liquid in the wells acting as technical replicates was pooled (five wells per treatment) to increase the amount of DNA collected per sample. The total volume of each pooled sample was 550 µl, of which 80 µl was fixed with filtered glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration) for flow cytometry analysis (conducted on fresh samples the same day) and 470 µl was snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA extraction and sequencing. In addition to the ISCA samples, bulk seawater samples (n=4) were also collected for both flow cytometry and DNA sequencing. Water temperature and salinity were recorded with a multiprobe meter (WTW Multiparameter Meter, WTW). Although the deployment enclosure was required to generate a microenvironment that is analogous to that experienced by planktonic bacteria interacting with chemical hotspots in the water column, the manner in which the ISCA is housed is entirely dependent on the scientific question investigated. One may wish to study the interaction of bacteria with cues released from surfaces, such as in the benthic environment. In this case, the surface is stationary but the bacteria are advected by the flow, a scenario that is best replicated by deploying the ISCA without an enclosure.",1

We added 50 µL of a bacterial suspension, and placed the samples in the testing apparatus. Since the volume of the bacterial suspension was much larger than the inner volume of each micro-trap, we could quantify the accumulation of bacteria inside individual micro-traps while neglecting the depletion of bacteria in the outer medium, i.e., the micro-traps are considered immersed in an infinite bacterial suspension. To measure the accumulation of bacteria inside the microtraps, we counted the bacteria in a volume corresponding to an area of 40 × 40 µm and a height of 10 to 40 µm. We compared the obtained value with the number of bacteria in the same volume outside the structures at the same height from the bottom coverslip.  For the experiments on bacterial depletion with deployable micro-traps (shown in Fig. 3a−c), nine µL of LB medium were added to the tubes containing the micro-traps. To make sure that the medium had penetrated inside the micro-traps, a 50 mBar vacuum was applied again for 5 minutes. Control samples followed the same procedure. In each tube, we inoculated 1 µL of E. coli, grown in 5 mL of LB at 37 °C up to a density of ~0.7 OD600-. The tubes containing bacteria and micro-traps were mounted parallel to the surface on a vertically rotating wheel at ~1.4 rpm at room temperature to avoid precipitation. At different time points (depending on the experiment), 2 µL of the supernatant from the respective samples were collected and the bacteria counted by optical micros- copy (Olympus® CKX41) in a Leja™ micro-chamber slide. Five different areas of the micro-chamber for each sample were photographed and analyzed by ImageJ software to determine the number of bacteria present. The counting method was validated with a separate experiment where OD reading were used as a reference (see Supplementary Fig. S6), the correlation between the two measurement was linear with R2 = 0.93.

An ISCA device consists of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structure bonded to a glass slide, forming five replicate circular wells, each having a volume of ~110 µl that connects to the outside through an acentrically placed 0.8-mm-diameter inlet port. Wells were filled through the inlet port with a chemoattractant solution to the top, with care to leave a small (5 µl) droplet on the surface of the inlet. The filled ISCA device was then placed in a petri dish, which was very slowly filled with 55 ml of a suspension of E. coli at a density of 2 × 106 to 4 × 106 cells ml-¹ (in motility buffer, preheated at 37°C) until the ISCA was completely submerged. After 35 min of incubation at room temperature (22°C), the external cell suspension was removed by pipetting, and the ISCA surface was wiped with a clean tissue. The contents of each ISCA well were collected with a 1-ml syringe and a clean needle, transferred to a 200-µl well of a flat-bottom 96-well culture plate, and mixed with 1 µl of a 1:100 dilution of SYBR green I for cell staining. Stained cell suspensions were kept on ice until all samples were obtained and then aspirated into a Becton Dickinson flow cytometer, operated at 30 µl min-1 and counted over 60 s. From the cell counts (number of cells per microliter) determined by flow cytometry for each ISCA well, we computed the mean and the standard deviation across the five replicate wells. The results presented in Fig. 4 were then obtained by normalizing to the mean cell count obtained with the ISCA for the same strain on the same day over five replicate wells containing only motility buffer (no-chemoattractant control), to quantify the enhancement in cell concentration due to chemotaxis (*normalized accumula- tion*).",1

A drop of 7 µl of this cell suspension was spotted on a 1% (wt/vol) agarose (in motility buffer)-coated microscopy slide (layer thickness, 1 mm) and then covered with a regular 0.17-mm-thick glass coverslip. Cells were imaged at an exposure time of 50 ms (phase-contrast) or 750 ms (mCherry) with a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E inverted microscope, equipped with an ORCA-flash4.0 camera (Hamamatsu) and a Plan Apo 1100 ×1.45 oil objective (Nikon).

Briefly, the day before pulsing, cells from freezer stock were cultivated in LB media for 3-5 h, then diluted 1:20 into 5 ml total of M9 media (see (Link et al, 2015) for recipe), and cultivated for 4-5 h to OD 0.1-0.2. 500 µl of the 5 ml inoculum was dispensed into 35 ml of M9 media and cultivated overnight at 30°C. The next day, cultures were typically at OD 0.2-0.3 and were then moved to 37°C and cultivated until OD 0.8-1.2. At this point, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3 min at 5,000 g) and resuspended in 32 ml of diluted M9 media without glucose (1:8 dilution with filtered water). This point signified the start of starvation. Cultures were then cultivated without glucose for 2 h before the start of pulsing. Glucose pulsing was accomplished using two systems (Fig 1). With the spin flask system, an IDEX Corporation Ismatec MCP 404 pump was programmed to dispense 22 µl of 2.5 g/l glucose solution to a 32 ml culture within a Schott bottle. Starved cultures were transferred to Schott bottle just before the start of pulsing. Frequency/flow rate was controlled by setting pause time between dispensations. Cultures were constantly mixed using a stir bar and maintained at 37°C by submergence into a water bath. Optical density (OD) was measured in a Pharmacia Novaspec II spectropho- tometer. In the plate reader system, a Tecan Reader Infinite 200 with injector was programmed to dispense 4 µl of 1.08 g/l glucose solution to a 2.5 ml culture in 6-well plates ((Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plate reader cultivations were performed at 37°C and with orbital shaking at maximum amplitude. An empirical function was used to convert OD measurements from the plate reader system to the spec- trometer one. Final concentrations of antibiotics were as follows: 100 µg/ml of ampicillin, 34 µg/ml of chloramphenicol, 50 µg/ml of rifamycin, and 100 ng/ml of azidothymidine. For plasmid titration experiments, doxycycline was added to the media at the onset of starvation. Each inducer concentration was cultivated in separate shake flasks during starvation. A titration curve is shown in Appendix Fig S9 for the plasmid expressing GFP. 50 ng/ml working concentration of doxycycline was used for maximal synthesis, 10 ng/ml for half synthesis, and none for zero synthesis. For the protease inhibitor experiment, a completeTM EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) tablet was dissolved in 2 ml of diluted media to form a stock solution. The stock solution was diluted 1:10 in M9 media without carbon source, inoculated with wild- type E. coli, and cultivated for 2 days at 30°C to catabolize latent carbon within the cocktail solution. Cultivation was then pelleted, and the supernatant was collected and sterile filtered. Filtered, spent protease inhibitor solution was kept at 4°C for no more than 1 day before experiment.

Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Three-dimensional hydrodynamic focusing,"Among the many possible particle-focusing techniques (electric, acoustic, hydrodynamic, and geometry induced)44-49, we chose hydrodynamic focusing for its simplicity and versatility. In our design, a vertical sheath flow hydrodynamically pushes the cells upwards, focusing the sample stream in a region close to the glass coverslip. This ensures a high capture rate of cells by the optical tweezers, which are focused at a point 10 µm below the coverslip and have a tweezing force that attenuates rapidly with distance39. It also prevents the complex Raman spectrum of PDMS from interfering with the spectrum of the cells³7, since Raman measurements are acquired >30 µm away from the PDMS lower wall (Fig. 1a). The vertically focused sample stream is then focused horizontally to one side by a second sheath flow. Thus, cells that are not pulled out of the sample stream flow into the waste outlet by default (Supplementary Videos 3 and 5). The final design and flow rates were chosen to optimize vertical focusing, based on simulations performed with COMSOL Multiphysics (Supplementary Video 1) and experiments. To experimentally determine the effectiveness of vertical focusing, we seeded the sample stream with 1 µm polystyrene latex microbeads (Polysciences) and scanned the depth of the microfluidic device-top to bottom-in 2 µm steps using a phase-contrast microscope with a 20x objective (Nikon; Supplementary Video 2). We determined the vertical focusing effectiveness using: η (%) = D-d/D ×100 (3) where D denotes the depth of the microfluidic device in the analysis region (44 µm), and d is the depth of the sample stream as visualized by the latex beads (Supplementary Fig. 1a). As the flow rate ratio Qsheath/Qsample between the vertical sheath flow and the sample flow increases, the vertical focusing effectiveness increases up to a maximum of 61% (for Qsheath/Qsample=8.0). This ratio was used for all RACS experiments. The final flow rates of the sample fluid, vertical sheath fluid and horizontal sheath fluid are 0.01, 0.08 and 0.5 µl min¯¹, respectively. The withdrawal rate from the collection outlet is 0.15 µl min¯¹, while the waste outlet empties into a Milli-Q-filled Eppendorf tube (see the section *Experimental setup*). We noted that the precise location of the hole punched in the PDMS to deliver the vertical focusing flow is important in determining the focusing effectiveness. A misaligned hole causes flow recirculation that disrupts focusing (Supplementary Fig. 1c), and too large a hole reduces the focusing effectiveness due to the reduced fluidic momentum (Supplementary Fig. 1d).",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Experimental setup,"We based the system on a commercial Raman microspectroscope (LabRAM HR800; HORIBA Scientific), which is a modified upright microscope (BX-41; Olympus). Because Raman signals are intrinsically weak, imaging and Raman measurement must occur in isolation. Thus, the original system had a single optical path and used a removable beam splitter to alternate between two mutually exclusive modes: Raman measurement and microscopic imaging. To enable simultaneous measurement and visualization, the system was modified to create a *double-microscope setup* (Fig. 1d). The first optical path in the setup uses two continuous-wave neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet lasers: one for Raman measurements (532 nm) and one acting as optical tweezers (1,064 nm). Both are focused on the same location within the microfluidic device by a 60x water-immersion objective (UPLSAPO 60XW, numerical aperture = 1.20; Olympus). The 1,064 nm laser beam fills the back aperture of the objective, ensuring maximal optical tweezing efficiency for a given laser power50. After the two lasers have been focused on the glass coverslip (confirmed via inspection with CCD camera 1), a removable beam splitter is withdrawn, and scattered light is directed instead to the spectrometer for Raman measurements (Fig. 1d). The two lasers are then focused 10 µm into the fluid below the coverslip (that is, >30 µm above the PDMS surface) for RACS. Two notch filters (cutoff wavelengths: 532 and 1,064 nm) eliminate laser transmittance into the spectrometer, preventing the laser wavelengths from drowning the Raman signal. A grating divides the Raman signal into discrete wavelengths. The second microscope yields dark-field images, in which cells appear as bright spots on a dark background. To visualize single cells (~2µm) captured by the optical tweezers, we mounted a low-angle blue ring illuminator (30°; 470 nm; bandwidth: 450-475 nm; MLRL-CB25, MORITEX Corporation) surrounding a 10x objective (MPlan N, numerical aperture=0.25; Olympus), an optical array (3.5x magnification; Navitar) and a CCD camera (CCD camera 2; pco.1600; PCO-TECH) below the microscope stage. A shortpass filter with a cutoff wavelength of 500 nm (Thorlabs) is placed after the objective to avoid laser-induced photodamage to CCD camera 2. The ability to visualize tweezed cells allowed us to examine single-cell capture, translocation and release events to simulate the automated RACS during the choice of parameters (Supplementary Videos 6 and 7). We were also able to detect when captured cells were lost from the optical tweezers. This loss rate-a function of the flow velocity (drag) and laser power for a given objective-was minimized by maintaining a flow velocity of ~600 µm s¯¹. However, the low flow speed made it difficult to build a stable pressure balance between the collection and waste outlets. To address this issue, a constant flow rate (0.15 µl min¯¹) was withdrawn from the collection outlet. Additionally, to prevent sample fluid from invading the collection outlet during initial flow stabilization before the start of RACS, fluid was first introduced from the collection outlet before reversing the direction of flow. The microfluidic tubing at the waste outlet was connected to an Eppendorf tube filled with working fluid (reservoir). To prevent any extraneous biological matter from being collected, a syringe filter (0.1 µm pore size; polyethersulfone; Sartorius Stedim Biotech) was equipped at the glass syringe used to generate the horizontal sheath flow, and 0.5% Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich) in Milli-Q water was used in the collection syringe. Tween 20 in Milli-Q water was not used at the sample and sheath inlets because it interfered with the Raman measurements. To allow the stable injection of cells into the microfluidic device and prevent changes of concentration over time due to cells settling in the syringe, we designed an in-house magnetic stirrer (Supplementary Video 8) to continuously mix the sample fluid inside the syringe. Magnetic rods were attached to a compact 12 V d.c. motor shaft placed next to the syringe, and a parylene-encapsulated samarium-cobalt magnet disc (bio-compatible; 3 mm in diameter and 0.7 mm in thickness; VP 782S-3; V&P Scientific) stirred the cell-suspended sample fluid within the syringe. The d.c. motor (maximum 300 r.p.m.) was tuned using a current controller to give 100-150 r.p.m. Four main system parameters affect the Raman measurements, as follows. (1) Objective. We used a 60x, high-numerical-aperture (1.2) water-immersion objective. (2) Laser power. Maximum laser power is desirable for a strong Raman signal, but high intensity causes photophoretic cell damage (for example, 750 mW; Supplementary Video 9). We therefore used a laser power of 15 mW for the 532 nm laser (this was chosen based on S. typhimurium because it was most strongly affected by photobleaching among the four pure cultures tested). This is equivalent to an optical energy density of 65.5 MW m¯², given the objective numerical aperture of 1.2 and the beam spot size of 0.54 µm. Photo-induced damage of cells exposed to the 400 mW optical tweezers laser (1,064 nm) was not observed, which is consistent with a previous report39. (3) Grating. For faster RACS, a grating with 300 lines mm-¹ was chosen, which can sample 8 times faster than a 1,800 lines mm-¹ grating for the spectral region of interest (400-3,300 cm-¹) (Supplementary Fig. 12). (4) Pinhole (located before the grating). After testing Raman measurements with 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 µm pinhole sizes, the 300 µm pinhole was selected as it produced the highest ratio of cellular signal to background under the conditions applied.",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Raman intensity of the optically tweezed cell and background,"To compare the Raman intensity coming from the cell and background, we used a geometric optics approach. A rod-shaped bacterium aligned along the direction of beam propagation in the optical tweezers51,52 and 532 nm laser has Gaussian intensity distribution53: I (r, z) = 2P/πω(z)^2 exp (-2r^2/w(z)^2) (4) where P is the laser power, r is the radial position from the beam centre axis, and w(z) is the radius of the laser beam waist (z=0 refers to the centre of the laser focus). A diffraction-limited laser beam spot size (w) is calculated from the Rayleigh criterion: ω = 1.22λ/ΝΑ (5) where A and NA denote the laser wavelength and the objective numerical aperture, respectively. The laser beam waist along the z direction is then expressed as: w(z) = [w^2 +z^2 (tana)^2]^(1/2) (6) where a = sin-¹(NA/n) and n is the refractive index of the background fluid. The confocal length (depth of focus) is expressed by54: CL=socot(a) (7) where s = s/M, M is the objective magnification and s is the pinhole radius. To account for the collection rate of scattered Raman signal at the spectrometer from the local point in the confocal volume, a radial point source collection efficiency (K) is used54: k(r, z) ≃ exp {-(r/s)^2/[1+(1/2)(z/CL)^2]}/[1+(1/2)(z/CL)^2]^(1/2) (8) Because Raman signal intensity is proportional to the intensity of the incident photons and inversely proportional to the fourth order of the laser wavelength (P∝1/λ^4), the Raman intensities from the cell and the background fluid in the confocal volume are, respectively: I_cell = ∫_-Lo/2^Lo/2 ∫_0^(CL/2) ∫_0^ω(z) ∫_0^(2π) rk (r, z) I (r, z) cell dθdrdz (9) I_fluid = ∫_-CL/2^(CL/2) ∫_0^ω(z) ∫_0^(2π) rk (r, z) I (r, z) 5,fluid dθdrdz -∫_-Lo/2^Lo/2 ∫_0^ω(z) ∫_0^(2π) rk (r, z) I (r, z) 5,fluiddθdrdz (10) where Lo is the cell length. Scell and Sfluid refer to the absorption coefficients of the cell and fluid, for which we used 0.93 and 0.16, respectively, to simulate E. coli suspended in an aqueous medium55. In equations (9 and 10), we assumed that the cell has a rod shape. From these calculations, the numerical aperture and magnification of the objective and pinhole size are the main determinants of detection volume (confocal volume) of the confocal Raman microspectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 13). We found that the Raman intensity from a cell is substantially higher than that from the background fluid, allowing the RACS system to sort based on cell signals. With a 2.0 µm × 0.5 µm rod-shaped E. coli or a 0.75 µm spherical-shaped coccus cell, for example, approximately 85% of the Raman signal originates from the cell and only 15% originates from the surrounding medium (Icell/Ifluid = 6.22 and 6.13 for the E. coli and coccus cell, respectively) when the 60x, 1.2 numerical-aperture objective and 300 µm pinhole size are used. Spectrum acquisition can be optimized for different cell types by changing the optical pinhole.",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Sample preparation,"Generally, we followed the procedure described by Berry et al.27 for sample preparation. Four bacterial model species were used: E. coli (non-motile mutant; NCM3722 AmotA), B. subtilis (wild type; O11085), S. typhimurium (wild type; LT2 TSS495) and cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-labelled M. adhaerens (wild type; HP15 eCFP). For E. coli, B. subtilis and S. typhimurium, a single colony was picked from a Luria broth agar plate, inoculated into 3 ml of Luria broth medium, and cultured overnight in a shaking incubator (300 r.p.m. at 30°C). The next day, cells from the culture were diluted 1:200 into fresh media made with either 0% (that is, 100% Milli-Q) or 50% D₂O Luria broth medium. Cells were then cultured overnight. For M. adhaerens, 2216 medium (BD Difco) containing 50 µg ml-1 ampicillin was used. The media were either filter sterilized (0.2 µm pore size) or autoclaved before use. For experiments, cells were harvested from the stationary phase, rinsed three times in Milli-Q water by centrifugation (3 min at 7,000 r.p.m.) and resuspended in Milli-Q water. For M. adhaerens, artificial seawater was used to rinse and resuspend. For the mouse colon microbial community sample, colon contents of 6-8-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n=3) were harvested in an anaerobic tent. Contents from both male and female mice were collected and pooled. The sample size was determined based on the amount of colon contents required to perform each amendment and all necessary controls in three replicates. Colon contents were suspended in either non-D₂O-containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 50% D₂O-containing PBS and homogenized by vortexing, then 2.5 mg ml-¹glucose or 2.5 mg ml-¹ mucin from porcine stomach (both from Sigma-Aldrich) was added. After incubation for 6h at 37°C under anaerobic conditions, glycerol was added (to achieve a final 20% (v/v) of glycerol in the microcosms) and the vials were crimp sealed with rubber stoppers and stored at -80°C until further processing. The six-hour incubation led to only minor shifts in the microbiota composition (Supplementary Fig. 14). For experiments, these glycerol-cryopreserved cells were rinsed in PBS by centrifugation (3 min at 7,000 r.p.m.) and resuspended in 0.2 M glycerol (Milli-Q balanced). Sorting of cells from colon microbiota incubated for 6h in 50% D₂O-containing PBS in the absence of supplement (neither glucose nor mucin) showed that only 0.7% of cells (1 out of 134) display residual metabolic activity in the absence of an added substrate (Supplementary Fig. 15). For the mucin amendments, sorted fractions (a total of seven fractions collected) were obtained as replicates from three biologically distinct microcosms: microcosms MucA, MucB and MucC (Supplementary Table 2). Animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, and conducted in accordance with Austrian laws (BMWF-66.006/0002-II/10b/2010). For the marine enrichment culture, a marine sediment surface sample was collected from the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Vancouver, Canada. A small spatula of the collected sediment was transferred to marine mineral salt medium, incubated in the dark at 28°C without agitation, and repeatedly provided with 1 mM NaNO2 on depletion to enrich for nitrite-oxidizing cells. The marine mineral salt medium was modified from that described by L*cker et al.56 by replacing the natural seawater-water mix with 11 Milli-Q containing 33.4 g red sea salts (Red Sea Aquatics). The medium was supplemented with 4.2 µll-¹ vitamin solution medium (0.02 gl-¹ biotin, 0.02 g1-¹ folic acid, 0.10 g1-¹ pyridoxine HCl, 0.05 g1-¹ thiamine HCl, 0.05 g1-¹ riboflavin, 0.05 g1-¹ nicotinic acid, 0.05 g1-¹ DL-pantothenic acid, 0.05 g1-¹ P-aminobenzoic acid, 2.00 g1-¹ choline chloride and 0.01 g1-¹ vitamin B12). Enrichment was performed by transferring 10% of the culture into fresh medium four times before the RACS experiment. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,500g for 20 min at 28 °C; swinging bucket rotors) and resuspended in 1 ml of artificial seawater for the RACS experiment.",1

As shown in Supplementary Fig. 16a, the programme window of the platform allows the user to: (1 and 2) switch CCD camera 1 on and off; (3) start the calibration process; (4) start the automated RACS process; (5) set the threshold of Pc; (6) set the threshold of P₁; (7) view the measured Pc value in real time; (8) view the measured P₁ value in real time; (9) track the number of analysed cells; (10) track the number of captured and selected cells (identified as of interest according to the P₁ criterion); (11) track the number of captured and rejected cells (identified as not of interest according to the P₁ criterion); (12) view the proportion of selected cells among the analysed cells; (13) determine the stage position in the y direction (perpendicular to the flow direction); (14) stop the RACS process; (15) close the programme window; (16) view the real-time spectrum from the LabSpec6 monitor; (17) view the calibration spectrum; and (18) view the measured spectrum on cell capture in the optical tweezers. When the user clicks button (1), CCD camera 1 is activated and the Raman (532 nm) and optical tweezers (1,064 nm) lasers are visualized. Once the laser spots are focused at the bottom surface of the glass coverslip, CCD camera 1 can be disengaged by clicking button (2) and the system can be switched into Raman measurement mode as the user removes the beam splitter (Supplementary Fig. 16b; see Fig. 1d). On clicking button (3), the programme starts the calibration process: the optical tweezers move to the sample-free stream (270 µm away from the initial position) and measure 20 Raman spectra of fluid (background) with a 2s acquisition time. The measured spectra are then averaged (displayed at window (17)) and used as a control to detect single cells captured by the optical tweezers. On clicking button (4), the programme starts the RACS process: a Raman spectrum with 2 s acquisition time is taken every 2 s and the calculated Pc value is displayed at window (7) in real time. When the programme recognizes an optically captured cell (on the basis of the Pe criterion), the spectrum is shown at window (18) and the optical tweezers move to the evaluation location (their current lateral position is displayed at window (13)). After calculating P₁ using a new Raman spectrum (5 s acquisition time), the programme displays the P₁ value at window (8) and makes a decision according to the threshold set by the user at window (6). RACS is designed to be adjustable for diverse samples and molecules of interest, so that the acquisition times and thresholds must be set on the basis of experiments",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,"Recovery efficiency, sorting accuracy and live cell sorting","We evaluated the recovery efficiency (the percentage of sorted cells as counted by the programme that can be retrieved from the collection outlet for subsequent experiments) and sorting accuracy (the percentage of sorted cells that are actually labelled) with separate experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5). To estimate the recovery efficiency, overnight cultured deuterium-labelled E. coli were stained with DAPI (1:100 concentration; 358/461 nm for excitation/emission; this does not interfere with Raman measurements with the 532 nm laser; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min at room temperature to allow detection by epifluorescence, and used as a sample. After running the RACS procedure for 1h, the collected cells were deposited on a black filter (0.2 µm GTBP Isopore membrane filter; Merck Millipore). Deposition onto a small area (~1 mm diameter) was achieved by directly contacting a needle (connected to the tubing) and the black filter over a vacuum-assisted glass filtration apparatus. We then scanned the area with epifluorescence microscopy (LMD 7000; Leica), stitched the images together and counted the number of cells visible. We calculated the recovery efficiency: YL=RL/NL (11) where R₁ and N₁ are the number of cells counted on the black filter (that is, successfully recovered) and identified as deuterium labelled by the software, respectively. To measure sorting accuracy, unlabelled E. coli cells were stained with DAPI (1:100 concentration) for 10 min at room temperature and mixed 1:1 with deuterium-labelled cells. The procedure described above for the recovery efficiency was then conducted. In this case, stained cells counted by epifluorescence on the black filter represented false positives, for which the cells had probably fallen from the optical tweezers before being moved back to the waste stream. Factoring in the measured recovery efficiency, the sorting accuracy was calculated by: € = NLYL-RU/NLYL (12) where Ru represents the number of unlabelled (DAPI-stained) cells recovered on the black filter. Hence, a 0% sorting accuracy means that cells observed on the black filter are all unlabelled. To estimate the sorting accuracy while accounting for the mixing ratio between deuterium-labelled and unlabelled cells, we used the parameter Yu = Ru/Nu (where Nu is the number of *captured and rejected* cells displayed in the software window) to convert equation (12) into a population ratio-dependent form: € = NLYL-RU/NLYL = 1 - YU NU/YL NL = 1 - YU CU/YL CL (13) where C₁ and Cu are population densities of the deuterium-labelled and unlabelled cells in the sample flow. To demonstrate that the RACS protocol is also suitable for sorting isotopically labelled living cells for subsequent cultivation (without significant photophoretic damage by the 532 nm Raman laser exposure), we performed additional experiments and evaluated the recovery efficiency by cell culture (Supplementary Fig. 7). We ran the RACS system for 1 h with deuterium- and CFP-labelled M. adhaerens cells (CFP has excitation and emission wavelengths of 434 and 479 nm, respectively, and thus does not interfere with Raman measurements with the 532 nm laser), instead of DAPI staining (which is typically used for staining fixed cells). Cells recovered from the collection outlet were spread on a 2216 agar plate and colonies grown overnight at 37 °C were counted by epifluorescence microscopy. Dividing counts of growing cells by the number of cells recorded as *collected* by the RACS programme (equation (11)) yielded a recovery efficiency of viable cells of 81.8±5.9% (over 3 replicates).",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Error analysis,"To determine the effects of cell loss from the optical tweezers on sorting accuracy, we visualized the flow pattern in the microfluidic device by injecting a cell-suspended fluid simultaneously into all three inlets (the sample inlet and both sheath inlets) (Supplementary Fig. 2b and Supplementary Video 5). We found that the fate of cells lost from the tweezers depends on where during the 270 µm translocation (between capture and evaluation; Supplementary Fig. 4a) the cells are lost. Flow carries cells lost within the first 190 µm into the waste outlet, while those lost within the final 80 µm are carried into the collection outlet. Given this, we classify cell loss into six cases (Supplementary Fig. 4). In two cases (4 and 5), it is possible for cells lost in the collection stream to end up collected as false positives. The probability of these two cases is expressed as N(1-a)f(1-fo) (the same for each case), where N is the number of *captured and evaluated* cells, a is the proportion of the travel distance where flow ends in the waste outlet (that is, waste stream), f₁ is the cell loss frequency and fo is the frequency of deuterium-labelled cells among the population, N. From our estimation of cell loss from the optical tweezers, f₁ and fo can be expressed as (Na+(1-2)Na)/N and (N₁+N)/N, respectively, where N is the number of cells lost in cases 1-4 (that is, cells lost before they could be evaluated), N₁ is N subtracted from the number of *captured and selected* cells, N is the number of *captured and rejected* cells, and 2 is the proportion of deuterium-labelled cells within population N (that is, N₁/(N+N)). Based solely on the measured spectra during RACS (Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 3), we computed that cell loss from the optical tweezers could reduce the sorting accuracy by up to 0.3% (185 E. coli cells; N = 1; N₁=99; N=85), 5.1% (154 B. subtilis cells; N₁ = 12; N₁=72; N=69) and 1.2% (203 S. typhimurium cells; N = 4; N = 106; N=93) under the assumption that N₁ contains only deuterium-labelled cells. These predictions assume a constant probability of cell loss from the optical tweezers along their travel path, whereas during measurement we found that the probability is in fact higher at the onset of the tweezer movement. In this region, lost cells pass into the waste outlet, thus decreasing the actual frequency of wrongly sorted cells.",1

Pereira, Jen Nguyen, Vicente I. Fernandez, Anna J. Mueller, Filippo Menolascina, Holger Daims, David Berry, Michael Wagner and Roman Stocker",nature microbiology,Evaluation of sorting throughput,"The sorting throughput depends on the waiting time (the time needed to capture a cell in the optical tweezers, which in turn depends on the cell concentration in the sample), analysis time (the time for the quantification of Pc and P₁, and for the movement and return of the stage between the capture and evaluation locations) and probability of a successful Raman measurement for the evaluation of Pc at the capture location without loss of the cell from the tweezers due to collision with another cell. To evaluate throughput, we first modelled the probability of cell capture and successful Pc measurement as a function of the rate at which cells enter the optical tweezers and the measurement time for each Raman measurement. The rate at which cells enter the optical tweezers (cells s-1) is δ=CQa/A, where C is the cell concentration in the sample (cells ml-1), Q is the sample flow rate (here, 5.4×10-7 ml s-1 for the sample flow velocity in our experiments, U=600 µm s-1), a is the cross-sectional area of the optical tweezers (here, 2 µm × 2 µm, obtained using the laser beam waist, 2ω = 2 µm) and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample flow (here, 53 µm × 17 µm; see Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). Assuming that every cell entering the optical tweezers is captured, the probability, P, of successful Raman measurement of the captured cell to determine whether a cell is present in the optical tweezers (that is, the evaluation of Pc) depends only on the timing of the cell*s arrival with respect to the measurement and whether another cell collides with the captured cell during the measurement. Assuming that the cell arrivals are independent and that the process is stationary, we use a Poisson process model to calculate the probability of a cell capture and successful measurement of its Pc value, which yields P=e-2δTc sinh(δTc)/[1-e-δTc{cosh(δTc) - sinh(δTc) - 1}], where Tc is the measurement time used to quantify Pc (Tc=2 s in our experiments). The probability increases with cell concentration up to a maximum of 0.155 (regardless of Tc) as the rate δ of cell entry into the optical tweezers increases, but then decreases with further increases in δ due to the higher rate of collision between the cell in the tweezers and other cells in the sample flow (Supplementary Fig. 17a). The overall sorting throughput of the RACS system (number of cells collected per hour) is R=(1/(Tc/P+Ts))κ×3,600, where κ is the fraction of cells of interest (in this case, deuterium-labelled) within the sample and Ts is the sorting time, which comprises the time to compute P₁ (5 s in our experiments) and the time to move the stage back and forth between the capture and evaluation locations (2 s in total in our experiments). For the values used in our experiments (Tc=2 s; Ts=7 s), the sorting throughput is predicted to be R=4, 33 and 90 cells h-1 for cell concentrations of 106, 107 and 108 cells ml-1, respectively, when κ, for example, is 50% (Supplementary Fig. 17b). These values decrease to R=0.8, 7 and 18 cells h-1 for the same cell concentrations when κ is 10%. The rate-limiting step in the RACS sorting approach depends on the cell concentration. At low cell concentrations, the rate-limiting step is the entry of a new cell into the optical tweezers. For example, at 106 cells ml-1, a new cell enters the tweezers only every 6.9 min. In this case, a higher flow rate would increase the sorting throughput; for example, from R=4 cells h-1 to R = 19 cells h-1 when the sample flow velocity is increased from U=600 µm s-1 to U=3,000 µm s-1 and κ is 50% (Supplementary Fig. 17a). However, we note that stronger flows also increase the probability of cell loss from the optical tweezers due to the increased drag on the captured cell (Supplementary Fig. 4). Pre-concentrating cells increases throughput, but only up to a certain point, because the rate of cell collisions also increases: for example, for 5 × 108 cells ml-1, the predicted throughput drops to R = 33 cells h-1 for κ= 50% (compared with 90 cells h-1 for 108 cells ml-1; Supplementary Fig. 17b). In contrast, at high cell concentrations, the rate-limiting step is the analysis time. At 108 cells ml-1-a concentration of the same order as that used in our experiments-a cell enters the optical tweezers every 3.8 s and P is at its maximum value (Supplementary Fig. 17a), which means the system achieves its maximum sorting throughput for the given values of Tc and Ts. In this case, shorter measurement times Tc and Ts would yield a higher sorting throughput R (Supplementary Fig. 17c). This could be achieved by improvements to the instrument; for example, by increasing the power of the laser or the sensitivity of the Raman signal detector (see below). If the system could be improved to reduce Tc to 0.1 s (retaining T₁ =7 s), the throughput could increase from R= 90 cells h-1 to R=157 cells h-1 for κ=50% at a concentration of 108 cells ml-1. Moreover, if the system were to allow the simultaneous evaluation of Pc and P₁ values at the capture location (for example, Ts=2 s, which comprises only the movement of the stage), the predicted throughput becomes R=(1/(Tc/P+Ts/κ))×3,600. In this case κ affects Ts exclusively because only the cells of interest are moved to the evaluation location, which becomes simply a release location for the collection of sorted cells, and stage movement for non-labelled cells is avoided. With this approach, R increases considerably to 425 cellsh-1 for κ=50% (with C=108 cells ml-1 and Tc=0.1 s). More importantly still, with this approach, sorting becomes feasible also for samples with very low proportions of cells of interest: for example, when only κ=1% of the cells are of interest (for C=108 cells ml-1), R increases from 2 cells h-1 (with the current approach, that is, Tc=2 s and Ts=7 s) to 18 cells h-1 (for Tc=0.1 s and Ts=2 s) (Supplementary Fig. 17c).","1"

This capability was demonstrated by sorting cells from a marine enrichment culture (see above for sample preparation) that included cells with a high cytochrome c content, as indicated by the presence of the typical four strong Raman peaks of the electron transfer proteins at 750, 1,127, 1,314 and 1,585 cm⁻¹. Initially, the RACS platform was tuned to detect single cells from this enrichment that were randomly captured in the optical tweezers (in this case, using Pc> 1.1). In the next step, the RACS programme was customized to identify and sort cells containing high cytochrome c Raman signatures from the complex marine enrichment community using the spectral region 750-760 cm⁻¹ as a marker, as it showed the strongest signal intensity (Supplementary Fig. 6a). For all captured cells, Pcytochrome was calculated: Pcytochrome=I750-760/I1,850-1,900. As for P₁ determination, the integrated intensity I1,850-1,900 was used as a reference region. We first classified cells by hand as containing high cytochrome c Raman signals or not on the basis of their full Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig. 6a) and used this manual binning to determine a threshold value of Pcytochrome > 0.6 (Supplementary Fig. 6b). The platform correctly identified and sorted 75.8% of cells (55 out of 66) that contained high cytochrome c signals, while it rejected all cells that lacked high cytochrome c signals (that is, zero false positives). Further sorting criteria could include signals from cells containing storage compounds such as elemental sulfur*58, compounds that induce Raman resonance with the 532 nm laser such as carotenoids*59, and ¹³C-isotope-labelled derivatives*19 after stable-isotope probing experiments. Moreover, although not experimentally demonstrated, multiplexing of different Raman signals as a sorting criterion is also possible (for example, to collect only cells that display both a high cytochrome c and a deuterium signal).",1

It enables direct access to the genomes of microbes from complex microbial communities that respond metabolically to substrate additions or changes in other environmental conditions of interest. In this study, the RACS platform was applied to investigate mucin degradation by members of the mouse colon microbiota. Mucin is a highly glycosylated protein secreted by the mammalian colon that acts as an important barrier between the intestinal tissue and the microbiota, but which is also used as a nutrient source by gut bacteria*31. Mucin degradation, mediated by the secretion of enzymes such as neuraminidases, α- and β-galactosidases, N-acetylglucosaminidases, L-fucosidades and β-N-hexosaminidases, is thought to be confined to a small group of specialized organisms*36. Although genes involved in the partial or complete degradation of mucin are present in the genomes of a large fraction of gut inhabitants*72, only a small fraction of genes in the microbiota are transcribed in vivo*73. It therefore remains unclear how broad the mucin degradation guild is in situ. Our results suggest that mucin degradation is a process mediated by a phylogenetically diverse group of bacteria, although primary degraders belong largely to the Bacteroidetes (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, there appears to be specialization within the mucin-stimulated community, with only a small subset of species encoding the enzymes necessary to cleave the terminal sialic acid and sulfate residues from the mucin O-glycans (Fig. 4c; enzymes EC 3.1.6.14 and EC 3.2.1.18). Sialylated and sulfated glycans are abundant in mouse colon mucins; therefore, sialidases and mucin-desulfating sulfatases provide bacteria access to a fraction of mucin glycans inaccessible to the majority of potential mucin degraders. Organisms belonging to the family Muribaculaceae (Fig. 4c; Muribaculaceae bacterium MAG RACS_021 and Muribaculaceae bacterium MAG RACS_016) provide examples with this capacity. Members of the family Muribaculaceae are found in the guts of homoeothermic animals where they are thought to play an important role in modulating the host*s health*75,*76. Previously, insights about the role and niche occupied by these abundant components of the mouse gut microbiota were based solely on genomic analyses or in vitro phenotypic characterization of a single isolate*40,*77. Here, we have shown that members of this important family are stimulated by mucin, with at least two being part of a bacterial *elite* that can degrade nearly all of the O-glycans that constitute the mucus layer. Bacteria not able to cleave glycans were also identified, suggesting cross-feeding of sugars liberated by saccharolytic bacteria or utilization of their metabolic products. Together, these results suggest a model in which mucin degradation is mediated by a diverse group of primary degraders that cooperatively degrade this complex glycoprotein, and concomitantly support a community of cross-feeding heterotrophs as well as organisms such as sulfate-reducing bacteria that use the end products of mucin fermentation.",1

The hydrogel layer was prepared from a 3% (wt/vol) solution of agarose (SeaKem LE Agarose, Lonza) in buffer medium (consisting of motility medium for E. coli and filtered autoclaved seawater for M. adhaerens). This solution was heated in a microwave oven, then injected between two glass slides separated by a 1 mm silicone gasket at the edges, and allowed to cool.

The three channels were separated from each other by thin layers of PDMS (≤300 µm). The chemoattractant diffuses through the underlying hydrogel from the source to the buffer, which creates a steady concentration field in the hydrogel (linearly decaying between source and buffer) and consequently in the test section. In preparation for an experiment, the PDMS channel was placed in a vacuum chamber (-0.6 bar) for 6 min and the PDMS-on-hydrogel device was then filled with buffer medium (motility medium for E. coli and filtered autoclaved seawater for M. adhaerens). The chemoattractant gradient was allowed to develop through the device over 2.5-3 h in the absence of bacteria to allow time for diffusion from the source to the buffer channel. This time was sufficient to allow the concentration field to become established in the device, as verified experimentally by conducting tests using fluorescein (Supplementary Fig. 11). Each chemotaxis experiment began by placing a droplet of the cell suspension at the inlet and then inoculating the inlet port by using a thin syringe needle. Cells were then observed as they migrated through the maze. Each set of experiments was replicated three times. Experiments were conducted at room temperature.

The model reads дB/дt = DV2B - V·(vcB), (2) where the first term on the right-hand side accounts for the diffusion part, and the second term corresponds to the chemotactic drift. The chemotactic velocity vc is a function of the chemical concentration C and of its gradient ∇C. The chemical concentration is a linear function of the y-direction, stationary over time, so that ∇C is a constant. B(x, y, t) is the bacterial concentration in the maze over time. By employing parabolic scaling techniques, a recent analysis showed that the chemotactic drift in a (shallow) linear gradient54 (but see refs. 26,55 for a similar derivation in exponential gradients), such as the one employed in our experiments, can be expressed as a function of the ligand concentration and gradient K(C, ∇C) and the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χo vc = χoK(C) = χo(KA - K₁)∇C[(KA + C)(K1 + C)]−1, (3) with (see Supplementary Discussion) χo = 1/2v²(1 – αo)gτο = 1/2v²(1 − a)τ/TB, (4) where v is the swimming speed (more precisely, the run speed), vc is the chemotactic velocity, C is the chemoattractant concentration (methylaspartate), K1 = 18 µM and KA = 2.9 mM are the dissociation constants for inactive and active Tar receptors, αo denotes the steady-state kinase activity, and το = τ/TB is the average run time, where TB is the tumble bias and τt is the tumbling time. The pathway gain is g = NH, where H is the motor amplification coefficient, and N is the cooperativity, reflecting the number of receptors per cluster. The velocity of a swimming cell can be expressed as v = vr(1 − T), (5) where vr is the velocity during a run. In deriving Eq. (5) we are assuming that, because cells swim at low Reynolds numbers, the time required to accelerate from 0 to vr after a tumble is negligible compared to τt 56.

We fitted the slopes of the logarithm of B(x, y, t) for the two regimes. This slope is related to the chemotactic velocity of the bacteria, vc, and their diffusion coefficient, D. Within any T-junction the solution of the advection-diffusion model (Eq. (2)) at steady-state is B(y) = Bo exp[(vc/D)y]. The slope of the logarithm of B(y)/Bo is therefore vc/D.

Many details of the chemotaxis pathway that are known for E. coli (23–25) are not known for Vibrio ordalii, nor are such details known for most nonmodel bacteria. We therefore modeled Vibrio chemotaxis using a minimal model inspired by Long et al. (26) to combine the physical theory of Eq. 1 with the essential features of gradient measurement, adaptation, and motor out- put. For each bacterium, we model an internal state variable, S(t), which evolves according to (SI Appendix): $(t) = - + кM(x, v, t), S tm [2] where S = 0 is the adapted state, t™ is the adaptation timescale associated with methylation dynamics [~1.3 s in Vibrio (27)], Kis the receptor gain rescaled by the half-saturation constant, and M(x, v, t) is the (noisy) concentration gradient perceived by the cell, which is subject to the bounds of Eq. 1. Within each time interval of duration T, we model the gradient esti- mate as a normally distributed random variable, M(x, v, t) = Ν(μ, σ²), with mean µ = (d/dt + v.∇) C(x, t) and SD σ = II × omin = I [3 C(x, t)/παDcT³]1/2. Here, we have assumed that the SD of the cell*s estimate of the true ramp rate is pro- portional to the theoretical bound given in Eq. 1 with a pro- portionality constant equal to I≥1. We will refer to II as a *precision factor* because it expresses how precise a cell*s estimate of the gradient is relative to the theoretical bound. II=1 means the cell has reached the bound, II=10 means the cell is 10 times less precise than the bound, and so forth. This formulation assumes that noise in the dynamics of the internal variable can be captured as a multiple of the lower bound on noise in the gradient measurement itself. This can be interpreted as additional gradient measurement noise above the limit set by Eq. 1 [e.g., as a result of suboptimal measure- ment or transduction (14)] or as noise introduced later in the transduction pathway. We do not attempt to distinguish these possibilities. Eq. 2 involves two distinct timescales: the adaptation timescale t™ and the gradient estimate timescale T.

The agent-based model was compared with experi- mental data by fitting the precision factor II, the motor gain Г, and the rescaled receptor gain to data on the radial drift veloc- ity of bacteria from our experiment (SI Appendix). The results depend more strongly on the precision factor than on either of the gains (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).

In the absence of adaptation, this formulation allows one to calculate the expected length of a bacterial run, composed of multiple independent gradient measurements, Ĉ1,i (SI Appendix, Eq. S21). From this, the drift velocity can be written as an infinite series involv- ing the mean reversal rate for cells (SI Appendix, Eq. S22). The simplified model successfully predicts the spatiotemporal response of bacteria in experiments (Fig. 3C) and could there- fore be embedded in advection-diffusion models for chemotaxis (17, 35).",1

One example is phycospheres in the ocean, the regions surround- ing individual phytoplankton cells that are rich in DOM (9, 36). The continuum theory predicts a short period of active bacterial recruitment via chemotaxis (Fig. 5A), followed by many min- utes of random motility-induced motion with drift ≈0 (Fig. 5Β). These predictions are consistent with the azimuthally averaged bacterial concentration from experiments (Fig. 5 C and D). The peak value in bacterial concentration occurs in the center of the glutamate pulse at t≈60 s (Fig. 5C). The relaxation back to a spatially uniform distribution is well described by a diffusive pro- cess, with an estimated diffusion coefficient of the bacteria of DB = 165 µm².s-1 (Fig. 5 D, Inset). The lifetime of the bacte- rial accumulation is almost an order of magnitude greater than the duration of chemotaxis, indicating the long-term legacy of short-term initial recruitment. Processes such as collective nutri- ent cycling (9, 37), horizontal gene transfer (38), and infection by pathogens (39), which depend on local bacterial concentra- tion, may therefore be influenced well beyond the time when chemotaxis ceases.",1

Levin, and Roman Stocker",PNAS,Discussion and Conclusions,"Bacteria in the ocean encounter nutrient pulses from a range of sources. Our experimental system is designed to mimic a range of unsteady nutrient sources, such as the diffusive spread- ing of a plume behind a sedimenting particle (40), a nutrient filament produced by turbulent mixing (17), or the spread- ing source from a lysing phytoplankton cell (9, 41). Through experiment, theory, and numerical simulations, we have shown that the chemotactic motion of cells toward an unsteady nutri- ent source can only occur in discrete zones where the gradi- ent signal is not obscured by noise. Importantly, our results demonstrate that there is a clear and predictable delineation between zones where chemotaxis can occur and those where it cannot. For many real nutrient sources, the stochasticity in the chemoattractant is essential in understanding the chemotactic footprint. However, in many existing models for chemotaxis, it is assumed that cells are able to perfectly measure changes in their surrounding chemical concentration. This determinis- tic sensing is equivalent to setting II=0 in our model and assumes that variations in the gradient estimate are negligible. The fit of simulations performed in the absence of noise (i.е., II=0) to drift velocity data has a mean fitting error 10 times that of the model with II = 6.6 (error 5.2 µm/s compared with 0.51 µm/s). However, the importance of noise will diminish at higher chemoattractant gradients. As the initial concentration of glutamate in the patch, Co, is increased, the maximum sig- nal bacteria experience, max(dC/dt+v∇C), increases pro- portionally with Co, while the uncertainty in the measure- ment scales sublinearly, σε ~ √ Co (Eq. 1). This could explain why models with deterministic sensing (6, 42) are capable of matching experiments performed with steep gradients at higher concentrations. Is it surprising that V. ordalii operates so close to the limit of sensory precision? On one hand, it is intuitive that more precise sensing should facilitate better responses to the envi- ronment, and so natural selection should lead to bacteria capa- ble of making precise measurements of the gradient. There is only a marginal difference between the nutrient exposure for cells with the sensory precision of V. ordalii, compared with cells with the theoretical optimum sensory precision (Fig. 4). However, sensory precision comes at a high cost (43). Sup- pressing internal noise in biochemical networks, for example, generally requires that a cell produce and maintain a greatly increased number of signaling molecules (34, 44), implying that cells must trade off the costs and benefits of noise suppres- sion. Two potential ways for a cell to increase its chemotaxis performance are (i) by increasing swimming speed (16), which comes at the cost of devoting more energy to locomotion (45); and (ii) by increasing its chemotactic precision (i.e., decreasing II), which comes at the cost of tighter regulation of noise in the signal transduction pathway (34, 44). Although we cannot here quantify the costs of noise suppression in the chemo- taxis pathway, the plateaus in Fig. 4E for I≤6 hint toward an optimal value of precision, beyond which the additional resource gain may not outweigh the cost required to suppress internal noise. We note that noise in the chemotaxis pathway, however, does not always degrade the ability of cells to climb gradients. In contrast with our result on the negative effect of (upstream) counting noise on chemotactic performance, recent studies with E. coli (46–48) demonstrated that (downstream) signaling noise plays an important role in coordinating multiple motors (49) and can increase chemotactic sensitivity. Rigorous calculations in such model species where the chemotaxis pathway is better established may help shed light on the importance of correla- tions in measurement noise, out-of-equilibrium dynamics, and simultaneous contribution of multiple noise sources. We have shown that sensory noise places fundamental con- straints on the chemotactic abilities of cells and governs the density, spatial extent, and lifespan of bacterial aggregations. The timescale for initial recruitment through chemotaxis (tens of seconds) is much shorter than the lifetime of the bacterial",1

Average isotope ratios rc and rN of each single cell were obtained by averaging the values of all of the ROI pixels in the corresponding ratio image. In doing so, we assumed that the analyzed layer was representative of the entire cell.

The scaling properties of p(bv, V) cannot be inferred from the available experimental data since they would require binning in both v and b and very few data would fall in each bin. Nevertheless, knowing that p(biv, V) must be compatible with the form of the marginal p(b|V), we can make reasonable hypotheses on its shape. In particular, we can distinguish 2 cases, depending on whether the intraspecific size scaling of b has the same exponent a as the interspecific scaling, or a different one. The 2 cases are both compatible with the form of p(b V) supported by the data (Eq. 2), but the data do not allow distinguishing between the 2 for 2 reasons. First, the number of data points is not sufficient to verify the scaling form of p(b|v, V). Second, the intraspecific scaling of b shown in Fig. 2 A and B is affected by our assumption that the C and N content of cells scales with volume at the intraspecific level with the same exponent of the interspecific scaling. This assumption needs to be verified experimentally before drawing conclusions regarding the intraspecific scaling of metabolic rates (b|v, V) with v. The 2 cases are as follows: Case 1. In the case in which the intraspecific scaling of b has the same exponent of the interspecific scaling, a reasonable further assumption is p(b/v, V) = p(b/v) = (1/va)G1(b/va) [5] where G1 is a function with the same properties of G (SI Appendix). Note that Eq. 5 (but not our Eq. 2, in which p(b V) is conditional on the aver- age species* mass) corresponds to equation 2 of ref. 14, where data on the metabolic rate of small mammals were shown to be compatible with it (to show that Eq. 5 and equation 2 of ref. 14 coincide, one needs to multiply and divide Eq. 5 by va and recognize that (b/va)-1G1(b/va) is still a function of b/va). This assumption means that, knowing the individ- ual body size v, the average species body size V does not give any further information on the individual metabolic rate. This hypothesis implies that = ∫ db b p(b\v, V) ∝ va (SI Appendix); therefore a is the exponent of the intraspecific size scaling of b. The joint distribution would then have the form p(v, b/V) = F(v/V) * (1/va)G1(b/va) = (1/V)H1 (v/V, b/va) [6] where H1 (x, y) = F(x)G1(y/xa). This form for the joint probability distri- bution is compatible with the marginal distribution in Eq. 2, for which x Va; i.e., the exponent of the interspecific scaling of with V is equal to a. Case 2. If the intraspecific scaling of b has a different scaling exponent than the interspecific one, we can hypothesize p(b/v, V) = (1/va)G2(v/V, b/va) [7] See SI Appendix for the properties of G2(x, y). Eq. 7 implies = ∫ bp(b\v, V)db = va+η Q(v/V) [8] where Q(y) = ∫ G2(x, y)dx. To have a power-law intraspecific size scaling of b, we need therefore to ask Q(y) ∝ yη, which gives ∝ va+η(V/v)-η [9] Therefore, intraspecifically (i.e., for fixed V) the scaling exponent is a + η. In this case, the joint distribution has the form p(v, b/V) = F(v/V) * (1/va)G2(v/V, b/va) = (1/V)H2 (v/V, b/va) [10] where H2(x, y) = F(x) G2 (y, x). This functional form for p(v, b V) is again compatible with the function form of Eq. 2 for the marginal distri- bution p(b|V), and thus the interspecific scaling of with V is equal to a.",1

Durham",SCIENCE ADVANCES,Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of turbulent flow,"We modeled a homogeneous, isotropic turbulent flow field by direct integration of the Navier-Stokes equations without any closure model. This method, known as DNS, is computationally expensive but yields the most accurate representation of small-scale turbulence possible. The Navier-Stokes equations are given by ГдиP+(u-V)] = -VP+Vu+ fdtwhere u is the fluid velocity; P is the pressure; μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity; f is a zero-mean, temporally uncorrelated Gaussian forcing to sustain statistically steady turbulence; and flow is incompressible such that Vu = 0. The computational domain is a cubic box with triply periodic boundary conditions. The solution of Eq. 3 is time-advanced using a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme, while the Poisson equation for the pressure is solved with a spectral method. The unsteady forcing is spread over a narrow shell of small wave numbers to generate large-scale flows. To eliminate aliasing errors, we used the 2/3 dealiasing technique, which sets the largest 1/3 of all wave numbers to zero after each computation of the nonlinear terms in the Navier-Stokes equations such that the largest resolved wave number is kmax = +M1/3. We used a Fourier pseudospectral code to simulate the flow using M = 1283 mesh points, which ensures that the smallest eddies in the flow are adequately resolved (kmaxηκ ≤ 1). At steady state, the average rate of kinetic energy dissipation per unit volume, e, is equal to the average rate of energy injected into the system through the large-scale forcing. The total dissipation rate can be directly calculated by integrating the dissipation spectrum D(k) over the entire range of wave numbers £ = SD(k) dk = 2vfk²E(k)dkwhere E(k) is the energy spectrum. A measure of the diversity of length scales within the turbulent flow is given by the Taylor Reynolds number, Rex = urms/v, where urms is the root mean square flow velocity, v is the kinematic viscosity, and λ = 15vums/e is the Taylor length scale. Our simulations used Rex = 62, which previous work has shown to be sufficient to resolve the interactions of gyrotactic swimmers with turbulent flow (20).",1

Durham",SCIENCE ADVANCES,Individual-based model of gyrotaxis,"To resolve how phytoplankton chains migrate through the DNS of turbulence, we initialized our computational domain with 100,000 Lagrangian swimmers after the turbulent flow had reached a statistical steady state. The initial positions of swimmers were randomly (Poisson) distributed in space, and their initial swimming directions, p, were randomly distributed on a unit sphere. At each time step of the simulation, the fluid flow properties (u, w, and E) at the location of each swimmer were calculated using trilinear interpolation, and the swimmer orientation and position were integrated using a second-order Adams-Bashforth scheme. All of our analyses were performed after swimmers had reached a statistically steady distribution, which, in our simulations, corresponds to one to two integral time scales, which is the turnover time of the largest eddies in the flow (equivalent to approximately 40 Kolmogorov time scales). We verified the convergence of our analyses using separate tests that integrated the trajectories of 300,000 swimmers until they reached a statistical steady-state distribution. Our simulations modeled cells as point-like particles, which previous studies have found to be a good approximation provided that the particles are smaller than approximately 2ηκ or 3ηκ (39, 40). The Kolmogorov scale for the largest turbulent dissipation rate considered here (c = 10¯º W kg¯¹) is nҝ = 1 mm, suggesting that the point approximation is valid because the longest chains are typically less than few hundred micrometers in length (3, 6, 8, 14, 16, 17, 19). We also note that Eqs. 1 and 2 do not include the effect of phytoplankton inertia, owing to their small size and density close to that of the water in which they live (33). Furthermore, our model also assumes that phytoplankton chains are rigid and do not bend in flow.

Each PDMS (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning) device was bonded to a glass slide by plasma treatment of each interacting surface for at least 1 min, and the assembled chip was then incubated for at least 2 h at 80°C. On the morning of each experiment, bonded channels were cooled to room temperature and were then treated with a 1:10 dilution of poly-L-lysine (catalog no. P8920; Sigma) in Milli-Q water. This treatment enhanced cell attachment but did not affect the growth rate. YFP-labeled wild-type cells and CFP-labeled mutant cells were grown overnight in M9 medium with glucose and ampicillin. The cultures were then inoculated into fresh M9 medium with glucose and ampicillin. After growing to an OD of 0.5 to 1.0, the cells were filtered and transferred to a 1:8-diluted M9 medium without glucose (starvation medium) to a final OD of 0.2. Afterwards, the cells were inoculated into the microchannel. Connecting all inputs and outputs to the microchannel took about 10 to 15 min, allowing ample time for cells to settle and attach to the glass surface within each microchannel before a flow was established. By the onset of the fluctuating nutrient signal, cells had been without carbon for at least 30 min. The fluctuating signal delivered a carbon-free morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS) medium (Teknova) for 5-min periods, separated by 30-s periods of 2% LB medium (100% LB medium diluted in MOPS medium). The same 2% LB medium was delivered steadily to the nonfluctuating control environment.",1

A. Moran, University of Georgia) to visually report expression of DMSP degradation genes (dddW and dmdA). DddW was chosen due to its strong upregulation response to DMSP reported in previous transcriptomic studies11,17, which suggests that DddW is the primary DMSP lyase in R. pomeroyi DSS-3. Three fluorescent proteins were chosen for brightness, monomeric structures, and spectral separation: mTFP1 (teal)36; mVenus-Q69M (yellow)37, which is the mVenus YFP38 modified with a Q69M mutation to reduce environmental sensitivity; and mKate2 (far-red)39. To control for bias caused by the choice of color of fluorescent protein (RFP or TFP) fused to each promoter region, we constructed two R. pomeroyi reporter strains (Goofy and Regular) in which we interchanged the fluorescent proteins fused to dmdA and dddW promoter regions (Fig. 1a, b). Three promoter fusion cassettes were inserted into a single vector backbone (pBBR1MCS-2, a 5.144 kb, broad-host-range, medium copy number plasmid with a kanamycin resistance cassette and origin of replication pBBR1, originally isolated from Bordetella bronchiseptica)40,41 to enable gene expression readouts from individual cells (Supplementary Fig. 14): a dmdA promoter reporter cassette; a dddW promoter reporter cassette; and a constitutively expressed yfp cassette (Fig. 1a, b). The 500 bp sequence upstream of the dddW gene and 222 bp upstream of the dmdA gene in the R. pomeroyi DSS-3 genome were determined as putative promoter regions and used to construct promoter reporter cassettes. A strong, constitutive synthetic promoter PA1/04/03 (an E. coli lac promoter derivative)42,43 controlled the expression of YFP, whose intensity was utilized as a proxy for cell viability, plasmid copy number, and metabolic activity (Supplementary Fig. 15). Transcriptional terminators (RNAI, TSAL, TR2-17, TL17, BS7, and T7TE+) and spacer regions between promoter fusion cassettes were cloned from plasmid pZS2-12344. As an intermediate step in the construction of the tricolor reporter strains, a derivative of pZS2-123 (with its original promoters replaced with 500 bp sequence upstream of dmdA or dddW genes), pZS2-200, was built using restriction enzymes: AvrII, Xmal, Xhol, BamHI, XmnI, and SalI (New England Biolabs).",1

For each biological replicate, 153 ul of concentrated overnight culture was used to inoculate subculture flasks containing 115 ml of 10 mM glucose MBM amended with 25 µg ml-¹ kanamycin. This led to a cumulative dilution factor of 1/75 (vol/vol) of overnight culture for subculture preparation, consistent with microfluidic experiments. Subcultures were incubated in the dark at 30 °C on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) for 4 h, at the end of which OD700 was measured to be 0.02-0.04. A volume of 110 ml of subcultured cells per biological replicate was washed and concentrated fivefold in non-carbon amended MBM and 7.2 ml of this concentrated cells was allocated into each treatment flask of each biological replicate (150-ml glass Erlenmeyer flasks). The addition of 800 µL concentrated DMSP solution stocks (10x concentration, i.e., 10 μΜ, 750 µM, and 10 mM) and kanamycin (final concentration = 10 µg ml-1) marked the initiation of incubation, with a starting volume of 8 ml. Final cumulative concentration from subcultured cells was 4.5x (nearly consistent with microfluidic experiments). One replicate of blank control flasks (i.e., without cells) representing each DMSP concentration condition was also prepared. All experimental flasks were sealed and incubated in the dark at room temperature (21.4-22.8 °C) and in the absence of agitation. At each sampling time point, incubation flasks were swirled to resuspend sunken cells. From each flask, a 1.5-ml sample was taken for DMSP concentration measurement, and an additional 10-ul sample was placed in a microfluidic observation chamber for microscopy observation (imaged as described above). The first time point (0h) was taken from the blank control flasks, for measurement of initial DMSP concentration. Subsequent time points, at which samples were taken from blank control flasks as well as from all replicate experimental conditions, were approximately 2, 8, and 24 h after the start of incubation with DMSP. Each sample was immediately centrifuged at 2500 × g for 3 min to remove cells from solution. One millilitre of the supernatant was placed in an acid-washed 5-ml glass scintillation vial containing 3 ml methanol (>99.9%, HPLC gradient grade; VWR International). Sample vials were sealed and stored in the dark at 4 °C until DMSP concentration measurement using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC/HRMS).",1

Three incubation conditions were tested to probe the effect of sulfur satiation (due to pre-exposure of R. pomeroyi to 10 mM methionine) on DMSP uptake and cleavage pathway expression: [2H6]-DMSP without pre-exposure to methionine; [2H6]-DMSP with pre-exposure to methionine; and non-labeled DMSP without pre-exposure to methionine (negative control for Raman micro-spectroscopy signal). The Pdddw::mTFP1 single-color R. pomeroyi reporter strain (cleavage pathway promoter-fusion with TFP) was used to avoid spectral interference with Raman microspectroscopy measurements (see below).

Each flight consisted of 14 zero gravity parabolas, together with one Lunar and one Martian gravity parabola. Parabolas were grouped into four sets of four parabolas with a five minute break between sets, and approximately 90 s of 1 g between individual parabolas. Zero gravity was experienced for approximately ~22 s per parabola, slightly extended for the Lunar (~25 s) and Martian (~32 s) parabolas. Each parabola consisted of a pull-up phase (1.8g), zero gravity phase (0g, 0.16 g or 0.38 g depending on zero, Lunar or Martian gravity), followed by a pull-out phase (1.8g), before stable flight at 1 g. Five different gravity conditions could therefore be investigated (1.8 g, 1 g, 0.38 g, 0.16g and 0g).",1

A dual hierarchy of pore sizes was achieved using a monolayer of 3±0.02 mm borosilicate glass beads (SiLi Beads, Sigmund Linder GmbH, Warmensteinach, Germany) in which spherical hotspots (~6 mm diameter) of 0.751 mm glass beads (SiLi Beads, Sigmund Linder GmbH, Warmensteinach, Germany) were embedded (see Fig. 1 for a conceptual representation and photo). The regions of 3 mm and 1 mm beads are associated with pore sizes of approximately 1 mm and 300 µm, respectively. The choice of pore sizes was made to ensure saturation of the small bead hotspots even under hyper gravity (1.8g) during the pull-up and pull-out phases. The front cover plate of the pore networks consisted of glass with eight holes (4 mm diameter) to enhance oxygenation of the liquid phase. A PDMS membrane (125 µm thickness, SSP-M823-005, Shielding Solutions, Great Notley, UK) between the glass beads and the cover glass restricted liquid leakage whilst enabling diffusion of oxygen into the pore space. The PDMS membrane was attached to the cover glass by plasma treatment. The glass pore networks were sealed by sintering the beads and borders to the base plate and sealing of the cover plate using epoxy. Each network was connected to a liquid reservoir (an elastic balloon filled with 5 mL of bacterial growth medium encapsulated in a 3D-printed flask for stability) and a gas reservoir (a 50 mL IV bag, Easyflex+, Macopharma) using two Luer-Lock tubing adaptors (Matthes Sterilgutversorgung, Pockau-Lengefeld, Germany). Gas and liquid reservoirs were necessary to allow unconstrained movement of the liquid phase during reduced gravity.",1

A 40 µL aliquot of M9 minimal media agar containing 20 mM citrate was pipetted into each micro-bead hotspot inside the pore networks and immediately cooled to -20 °C for 30 s to ensure spatial confinement of the agar within the micro-bead aggregates. After solidification of the agar, 1 µL of bacterial overnight culture (diluted to OD600 = 0.1, corresponding to 50,000 cells) was pipetted onto the agar of each aggregate. Two motile bacterial species were chosen for this study, the obligate aerobe Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and the facultative anaerobic denitrifier Pseudomonas stutzeri A1501. These two species are commonly found in soil and the rhizosphere, are able to grow in contrasting environments concerning their oxygen preference and routinely cultured in defined media. Finally, oxygen optode foils were placed onto the upper four micro-bead aggregates and the network was sealed using epoxy. After sufficient curation of the epoxy (approximately 3 h), liquid reservoirs were saturated without pressure with M9 minimal media containing 20 mM of citrate and attached to the glass pore networks. An additional 2 mL of the same growth media was added to each network, saturating approximately the lower third of the pore space.

In each flight, two optode cameras were available to monitor two individual pore networks simultaneously. Each flight consisted of sixteen parabolas split into four sets (i.e., sets of four parabolas with 90 s intermissions followed by a five-minute intermission in-between sets). The first parabola set (all 0 g parabolas, same experimental conditions for both optodes) consisted of pore networks containing both species representing the main experimental system. In the second set (all 0 g parabolas), each species was inoculated separately (i.e., pore network containing only P. putida imaged using one optode, pore network containing only P. stutzeri imaged with the second optode). In the third set (all 0 g parabolas), a sterile pore network containing no bacteria was monitored using one optode, and another with both species but without the addition of the carbon to the aggregates using the second optode. In the final set of four parabolas, the pore network from the first set containing the two species was reused, and exposed to one parabola at Lunar gravity, one at Martian gravity, and two parabolas at 0 g. In addition, this verified that there was no change in observed response during the parabolic flight when comparing the first parabola with parabola 16. For the normal gravity (1g) and hyper gravity (1.8g) scenarios, images during normal flight (in between parabolas) and pull-up phase were used, respectively. Integrated over the complete parabolic flight campaign (both flights), this resulted in four biological replicates (individual pore networks) of the main experimental condition with each six technical replicates (individual parabolas) for 0 g and one technical replicate for Lunar and Martian gravity. All other conditions (individual species, sterile, no carbon) had two biological replicates with each four technical replicates.",1

Images were taken using an oxygen optode (Detector Unit DU01 with software AnalytiCall, PreSens Precision Sensing GmbH, Regensburg, Germany) every two seconds for the entire duration of the flight. Optode images were analysed using the KNIME software (KNIME AG, Zürich, Switzerland). After application of a Gaussian filter (σ = 2), RGB images were split into red, green and blue channels. Each hotspot was cropped to form an individual image according to manually created masks incorporating the maximal extent of the saturated area around the hotspot during the reduced gravity phase. Oxygen optodes contain two dyes: in our case, a sensitive dye emitting red fluorescence dynamically quenched by oxygen and a reference dye emitting constant green fluorescence. Oxygen concentrations can be estimated based on Fluorescence Ratiometric Imaging (FRIM) using the Stern-Vollmer relationship. This is essentially a two-point calibration taking the ratio of oxygen sensitive dye (red channel in the RGB image) to the reference dye (green channel in the RGB image) as an explanatory variable. Inability to obtain calibration images before the flight and a change of optical properties due to bacterial growth restricted the acquisition of reliable calibration images for each individual pore network. We instead calculated the change in oxygen levels during parabolas via a two-point calibration, taking the maximum R/G ratio as anoxic condition and minimum R/G ratio as oxygenated conditions. This approach could be verified by comparing calibration images (following the Presens calibration protocol) and an image of an inoculated network taken during the parabolic flight (SI Fig. 2). Due to the absence of an anoxic core in sterile networks, the mean R/G value used for the other calibrations (1.82) was used as anoxic calibration value in this case.",1

Only oxygen was used as a limiting substrate, supplied from the periphery and any unsaturated nodes concerning water at a concentration of 0.27 mM (oxygen saturation at 20°C). Matric potentials were calculated based on the elevation of the hotspot above the water table and the equation Ψ = pgh. where I is the water potential [kPa], p the density of water [1000kgm¯³], g the gravitational acceleration [m s¯²] and h the potential head [m]. Accelerometers on-board the aircraft provided measurements of gravitational acceleration. Bacterial biomass was estimated by considering individual agents with Monod growth kinetics to represent growth for simplicity. The total simulated time was 82 s (22 s plus each 30 s of hyper gravity) with 2 s time steps, covering both the hyper gravity and reduced gravity periods.

In order to ensure that the dominant velocity gradients occurred near the pillars, we designed the microchannel with aspect ratio H/W = 0.1 (height H = 100 µm; width W = 1 mm). To analyze surface attachment in flow around pillars of different wettability, we fabricated a microfluidic device with four channels on the same chip. Two channels were plasma-treated and bonded 5 days before the experiment, and two were bonded just 1 h before the experiment. Due to the PDMS hydrophobic recovery 64, surfaces with a very different contact angle were obtained (Fig. 6a; contact angle 95° ± 5° for the sample with 5 days of recovery time and of 15° ± 5° for that with 1 h recovery, estimated from images of water droplets on the surface). To analyze surface attachment in flow around pillars of different stiffness, we fabricated a microfluidic device with six channels on the same chip. Stiffness was controlled by altering the concentration of the cross-linking agent in the PDMS solution (Fig. 6d). Pairs of channels were produced by adding a cross-linker concentration of 3, 5, and 10% (typical concentration). All the channels were cured at 80 °C for 3 h, bonded to glass, and then stored for 24 h at ambient temperature to fully polymerize. According to literature65,66, the PDMS has a Young modulus in the range of 150 ± 50 kPa with a concentration of 3%, of 500 ± 100 kPa with 5%, and of 2.25 ± 0.25 MPa with 10%. To analyze surface attachment in sinusoidal and corrugated channels, we fabricated two microfluidic channels with one flat wall and the other wall having either sinusoidal features (Fig. 7a) or irregularly corrugated features (Fig. 8). Potential confounding factors stemming from cell growth, cell-cell signaling, extracellular matrix production and biological variability were minimized by focusing on early attachment (<5 h) and by performing experiments at different shear rates in parallel using a single cell culture. Flow was driven by a syringe pump (neMESYS 290 N, CETONI, Germany), using flow rates in the range Q = 0.6-6 µL min-1. Prior to use, all the microfluidic channels were washed with 2 mL of medium.

The silicon wafer was baked for 10 min to remove residual solvent, cooled to RT, and then exposed to 250 mJ cm² UV using multiple exposure modes on a mask aligner (Karl Suss MA6, SUSS MicroTec SE, Garching, Germany) through a high-resolution plastic photomask (Micro Lithography Services Limited, Chelmsford, UK). Wafers were postexposure baked at 65°C for 1 min and at 95°C for 5 min to cross-link UV-exposed areas and then slowly cooled back to RT (T = 22°C). Wafers bearing the first layer were used as substrate in a second layer deposition. Using a similar protocol but with a different photoresist (SU8-3010), spin-coating speed (1000 rpm), a new photomask, and altered baking times per manufacturer recommendations, a second layer of ~15 µm was deposited to create the microwell array (57 rows × 511 columns = 29,127 wells, filling the entire main channel area). After a second postexposure bake (65°C for 1 min and 95°C for 3 min), the resulting wafer was immersed in SU-8 developer (mr-Dev 600, MicroChem Corp.) to remove noncross-linked photoresist and then repeatedly washed with fresh developer and isopropanol. Features were visually inspected using an upright reflected light illumination microscope (Nikon Eclipse L200, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a 40× objective, and their heights were measured using a surface profilometer (Dektak Stylus Profiler, Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). Actual heights were 75 µm for the primary layer and 12.5 µm for the secondary (microwell) layer. The final wafers (= master molds) were placed in a vacuum desiccator, and (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane was deposited on the exposed silica surface to aid in the detachment of the microfluidic device after curing. Master molds were used as a substrate for poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) replica molding. PDMS was mixed with its cross-linker at a 10:1 (w/v) ratio and poured onto the master mold, which was placed in a desiccator chamber and degassed for ~15 min. Residual bubbles were removed using compressed air, and the PDMS was cured overnight at 80°C. Cured PDMS was manually removed from the master with a scalpel, and individual PhenoChips were cut to fit on a standard microscopy slide (25 mm by 75 mm). PDMS surfaces were covered in Scotch tape, and inlet and outlet holes were created using a biopsy puncher (1.5 mm in diameter, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA). PhenoChips were then bonded to isopropanol-cleaned microscopy slides using O2 plasma (Zepto 1, Diener electronics GmbH, Ebhausen, Germany) applied for a duration of 1 min at 50% maximal intensity. Bonding was finalized by placing PhenoChips on an 80°C hotplate for >3 hours. Devices were kept covered in Scotch tape in a Petri dish until use.

Omission of the vacuum step caused a number of wells to be air filled. Before loading, Symbiodinium cells (~6 to 8 ml) were mixed thoroughly by shaking the cultivation vessel and then centrifuged for 2 min at 1500 relative centrifugal force (rcf), the supernatant removed, and the cells were resuspended in ~100-µl f/2 medium. The resulting highly concentrated cell suspension was injected into the outlet of the PhenoChip until the microwell array was overlaid with cells. Cells were then loaded into wells by compressing the flexible PDMS main channel, which impressed cells into wells. Compression was achieved by gently placing the blunt end of a pair of forceps onto the main channel and slowly moving it across the main channel from inlet to outlet. This procedure lasted approximately 20 s. After this procedure, the remaining nonimmobilized cells were washed out of the main channel by flushing with a pipette. No further compression was applied for the remainder of the experiment, and cells were left in the open confinement of microwells hereafter. This procedure caused no significant difference in Fv/Fm between unrestricted and immobilized populations (P = 0.10, nonparametric two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test; fig. S1). The effectiveness of the loading procedure was found to depend principally on (i) cell dimensions, which can vary, e.g., among different growth stages of unicells; and (ii) well size, which can be tuned during device fabrication. We have successfully used PhenoChip to immobilize cells of varying sizes into microwells; i.e., Symbiodinium (10 to 12 µm in diameter in this study), unicellular cyanobacteria (Prochloron spp.; diameter, 5 to 25 µm), and red algae (Galdieria spp.; diameter, 5 to 10 µm). For Symbiodinium, in particular, we found that a well size of 20 µm was sufficient to accommodate all cell sizes within its lifecycle. The application of PhenoChip to other phototrophic cells requires verification that cells (i) remain immobilized within existing geometries for the desired experimental time frame; (ii) are unharmed by the loading procedure; (iii) emit enough signal for chlorophyll fluorometry (see below); and, if retrieval of cells is necessary, (iv) that cells can be removed using optical expulsion techniques (see below). It is important, for the use of PhenoChip, to ensure that the organism of choice is compatible with PAM-based variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. PAM measurements on certain cyanobacteria are, e.g., affected by nonvariable background fluorescence from phycobilisomes, the redox state of the plastoquinone pool, or respiratory electron flow in thylakoid membranes, and state transitions between PSII and PSI can occur in cyanobacteria and green algae, even under darkness. For Symbiodinium, a well diameter of 20 μm yielded a good compromise between loading efficiency (~40% of wells were routinely filled), multiple cell occupancies (~65% of occupied wells), and loss rate (1.4 to 4.2% of cell populations lost during a 4.5-hour experiment). To obtain higher loading efficiency, double occupancies were accepted, and the identification of single cells was performed during postprocessing using standard image analysis tools (see below).",1

Fernandez, Kang Soo Lee, Michael Kühl, Roman Stocker",SCIENCE ADVANCES,Temperature oscillations,"Large side channels (length, 24.5 mm; width, 2.5 mm) within PhenoChip were filled with a silver-laced epoxy polymer (Epo-Tek H20S, Ероху Technology Inc., Billerica, MA, USA) as previously used in microfluidic devices (3). This conductive path length was found to be sufficiently long to create homogeneous temperature gradients across the microwell arena. Because of the high viscosity of the polymer and the associated slow filling, compressed air was used to accelerate the injection of the epoxy and to create some overflow of the material in both the inlet and outlet of the channel. Small (1 mm in diameter) copper cables were inserted into the inlet and outlet, and the chip was left to cure at 80°C on a hotplate for 2 hours. Chips were tested for electrical conductivity using a DC power supply (RND 320-KD3005D, Distrelec group AG, Nänikon, Switzerland), and a temperature-sensitive liquid crystal (LC) sheet of appropriate temperature range (20° to 25° and 25° to 30°C; Edmund Optics, Barrington, NJ, USA) was placed onto the device. This permitted a rapid assessment of obvious heterogeneities in temperature gradients, which can occasionally occur at the connection wires (3), and allowed the most homogeneous devices to be chosen for subsequent calibration. Calibration of temperature gradients was achieved by first exposing LC sheets mounted on a microscope slide to known temperatures using a flow-through water bath (F32, JULABO GmbH, Seelbach, Germany) attached to a custom-made aluminum flow-through cell. The colorimetric changes occurring at specific temperatures were recorded using an RGB (red, green, and blue) camera (Canon EOS 6D, Canon Corp., Japan) under a homogeneous illumination field provided by a NeoPixel RGB LED 15 ring (Adafruit Corp., New York City, NY, USA), both attached to a dissecting scope (Nikon SMZ-U, Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Images were analyzed in Fiji (https://imagej.net/Fiji), and the intensity of the blue channel was found to follow a linear relationship with temperature. The same LC sheets were then used with PhenoChips to select the combinations of voltage and current to achieve the desired temperature gradients. The relation between input current and resulting temperature was linear (adjusted R² = 0.94; fig. S3), with a temperature increase of approximately +1°C above RT (measured in the middle of the main channel at constant flow) for each 2.5 mA increase in current (fig. S3). Confirmation of the resulting temperatures was obtained using a type K thermocouple thermometer with an accuracy of ±0.05% (Fluke 52II, Fluke, Everett, WA, USA), and measurements were performed with the probe fixed in the middle of the main channel, the source, or the sink. CFD modeling confirmed the linear nature of the thermal gradients and permitted the estimation of temperatures experienced by cells within the 57 rows of microwells in PhenoChip under progressively increasing temperatures (Fig. 2, A and B, and table S1). Because of the non-instantaneous nature of heat transport within multimaterial (glass, PDMS, and water) microfluidic devices, additional CFD modeling and time-lapse videography were used to obtain information about the time scale of heating and cooling, which demonstrated that steady-state temperatures (here defined as less than 0.05% temperature change) were established within ~300 s of heating or cooling (Fig. 2C).",1

Fernandez, Kang Soo Lee, Michael Kühl, Roman Stocker",SCIENCE ADVANCES,Solute gradients,"Solute mixing and delivery to cells was achieved using a Christmas tree gradient generator positioned before the microwell array (Fig. 1, A and D). To provide nonpulsatile fluid motion, low-friction 25-ml glass syringes (Hamilton 1000 series, Hamilton Corp., Reno, NV, USA) were used in conjunction with a Cetoni neMESYS syringe pump (Cetoni GmbH, Korbussen, Germany). All experiments were performed using a flow rate of 400 µl hour¯¹ injected into each inlet, a flow rate which was experimentally determined to not cause adverse effects via, e.g., shear stress (fig. S2). The accuracy of the mixing platform was tested by injecting deionized water augmented with sodium fluorescein at a concentration of 10 µM into one of the inlets and deionized water into the other. The resultant concentration profiles of sodium fluorescein were recorded using an Axio Scope Al upright fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Lumencor SOLA Light engine (Lumencor Inc., Beaverton, OR, USA) and a green fluorescent protein-specific fluorescence cube (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The resulting fluorescence intensities were used to validate a CFD model (fig. S7C). Direct calibration of pH gradients was possible by taking advantage of the pH-dependent changes in fluorescence emission of sodium fluorescein (15). For calibration, f/2 media with 10 µM sodium fluorescein and known pH (pH 4.0, 5.1, 5.9, 7.2, 8.1, and 9.0, measured and titrated to the desired pH on a FiveEasy Plus pH meter; Mettler Toledo, Columbus, OH, USA) were injected into the PhenoChip, and the resultant fluorescence was recorded at the entry channels of the microfluidic gradient generator into the main channel (fig. S7A). Between measurements at each level of pH, the chip was washed with deionized water until the fluorescence reverted to background values. This procedure yielded a pH calibration curve (fig. S7B). For experiments with Symbiodinium, gradients of pH were generated by injecting f/2 medium solutions of pH 4.0 and pH 8.1 (each containing 10 µM sodium fluorescein) into the two separate inlets. The resulting fluorescence gradients were used to calculate local pH concentrations based on the calibration curve. Using this approach, pH gradients (pH 4.0 to 8.1) could be generated within PhenoChip. All pH experiments used data from cells located directly after the entry channels of the microfluidic gradient generator (fig. S7a).",1

For the temperature gradients, the fluid flow and heat transfer were solved under laminar unsteady-state conditions, with no-slip boundary conditions at the microchannel walls. The following parameters were imposed in the numerical simulation: average velocity at the inlet of the middle channel, 0.0013 m s¯¹; pressure at the outlet of the middle channel, 0 Pa. An unsteady-state heat flux was set at the walls of the source channel. A convective heat flux condition with heat transfer coefficient h = 1000 W/(m²·K) and temperature T = 22°C was set at the sink channel.

For the modeling of chemical gradients, fluid in the device was assumed to behave as a constant incompressible fluid (water at RT), and the incompressible continuity and Navier-Stokes equations as well as the diffusion equation were solved for fluid flow and concentration analysis. Fluid flow was assumed laminar under steady-state conditions, with no-slip boundary conditions at the microchannel walls.

Fernandez, Kang Soo Lee, Michael Kühl, Roman Stocker",SCIENCE ADVANCES,PAM imaging,"A multicolor variable chlorophyll fluorescence imaging microscope (IMAG-RGB; Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich, Germany) was used to quantify the photosynthetic activity of individual cells. For Symbiodinium, visualization with a 10× objective (Zeiss Fluar 10x/0.5) was sufficient to obtain accurate fluorescence readouts with ~500 to 1500 cells per field of view, without noticeable drift in XYZ during experiments. A detailed technical description of the microscope system can be found elsewhere (35). Using the saturation pulse method (21), which is based on recording fluorescence yields before and during a saturating light pulse, the maximum quantum yield of photosynthetic energy conversion in PSII, Fv/Fm = (Fm – Fo)/Fm, was measured after cells were given an initial 15-min dark period. The effective PSII quantum yield, ÞII = (Fm* - F)/Fm*, was measured at saturating photon irradiances (defined below). Here, Fv, Fm, and Fo define the variable, maximal, and minimal fluorescence of dark-adapted cells, respectively; F is the fluorescence emission from dark-adapted cells, and Fm* is the maximal fluorescence of light-adapted cells. For a full overview of the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters used, we guide the reader to a comprehensive review (21). Dark-adapted maximum quantum yields, Fv/Fm, without continuous saturation probing was measured in determining the cell viability before and after LCM (fig. S10) and before and after cell immobilization (fig. S1). To determine the photophysiological effects of short-term temperature perturbations, maximum quantum yields, Fv/Fm, were determined in darkness at an acquisition frequency of 90 s between saturating probing light pulses for all temperature experiments (Figs. 3 and 4 and fig. S5) and during cell extractions (Fig. 6). This measurement interval apparently leads to incomplete dissipation of NPQ, altered redox states of the QA, and possibly other changes in the light harvesting antenna system of Symbiodinium (36). Consequently, this acquisition frequency caused a reduction of Fv/Fm by ~25% relative to the initial dark-adapted state, Fv/Fm (fig. S4). All temperature and extraction experiments were started after cells had reached steady-state values of Fv/Fm, immediately after the 10th saturation pulse (>900 s into the experiment). For pH experiments, ÞII was determined after cells had been incubated for 30 min with pH gradients and saturating photon irradiances previously determined for each strain (defined below). Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400 to 700 nm) was provided by RGB LEDs, which were calibrated before each experiment using a quantum sensor (MC-MQS, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) connected to a light meter (ULM-500, Walz). To determine the saturating photon irradiances for both strains, rapid light curves (relative electron transport rates, rETR, versus photon irradiance) were established using previously dark-adapted cells, which resulted in saturating photon irradiances of 108 µmol photons m¯² s¯¹ for strain CCMP2467 and 190 µmol photons m¯² s¯¹ for strain CCMP421 (fig. S8). Relative rates of PSII-driven electron transport were calculated using the system software as rETR = PAR × ÞII. Chlorophyll fluorescence images were captured using the supplied ImagingWin PAM software (Walz GmbH, Germany). The Imaging Win software enables correction for heterogeneities in the measuring beam, based on acquired fluorescence images with a homogeneous fluorescence standard in conjunction with a built-in background normalization of subsequent experimental images. Correct background normalization was manually inspected by comparing areas of interest on the outer edges of the images against those in the middle of the image. To prevent incorrect estimates of photosynthetic efficiencies, areas of heterogeneous actinic illumination, as previously identified via the fluorescence standard measurements, were excluded from all subsequent image analysis. In our PAM system, this resulted in the exclusion of the leftmost five columns of microwells from all images. After experiments, light transmission images were combined with PAM-derived image stacks within Fiji and registered to avoid artifacts arising from XY shifts. Single cells were manually identified within the light transmission image, and the resulting mask was used to quantify Fv/Fm and ФII from chlorophyll fluorescence images using an in-house Fiji script.",1

Fernandez, Kang Soo Lee, Michael Kühl, Roman Stocker",SCIENCE ADVANCES,Laser capture microdissection,"To test the ability to collect single cells from within PhenoChip after their phenotyping and confirm that they were not harmed by the process, cells of Symbiodinium CCMP421 were immobilized in microwells, and their maximum photosynthetic quantum yield, F/Fm, was measured in fully (15 min) dark-adapted cells (n = 303). The position of microwells was then used to identify the same cells on a laser microdissection platform (PALM MicroBeam, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Using this platform, individual cells were removed from microwells by applying a short (~200 ns) pulse of 355-nm laser light to the PDMS wall adjacent to the cell (distance, ~10 µm), always downstream of the flow direction. This resulted in the visible formation of a cavitation bubble (see movie S1), which dislodged immobilized cells (requiring an average of 1.5 attempts per cell, n = 189) and catapulted them into the laminar flow of f/2 medium supplied at a rate of 400 µl hour¯¹ in each inlet. During selection, particular care was taken to avoid introduction of undesired cells into the pool of selected cells. This involved (i) extensively and repeatedly washing the main channel before selection procedures to wash away nonimmobilized cells; (ii) repeatedly tapping PhenoChip with the blunt end of a pair of forceps after cell immobilization until cells no longer entered the flow stream (checked by microscopy); if possible, (iii) selecting cells close to the outlet to reduce the potential for contamination; and (iv) exchanging the tubing before each selection process. Ejected cells (n = 189) were collected downstream and pooled in a 2-ml Eppendorf vial. After centrifuging the vial at 1500 rcf for 2 min to remove the supernatant, cells were placed onto microscopy slides with a sealing gasket (height, 500 µm), covered with a coverslip and fully dark-adapted for 15 min before performing a single measurement of F/Fm. Using this procedure, 161 cells could be recovered. Cells unaccounted for (n = 28) were likely lost during supernatant removal or cell adhesion within tubing from the outlet. To demonstrate the use of PhenoChip to isolate specific cells for culture based on their phenotype, Symbiodinium CCMP2467 cells were immobilized and measured within PhenoChip for their maximum photosynthetic quantum yield, Fv/Fm, every 90 s for 30 min in previously dark-adapted cells (n = 70). Resulting Fv/Fm values were used to identify cells for subsequent ejection using LCM. For propagation, ejected cells were captured in sterile 2-ml low-absorption spectrometry vials (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) filled with 1.5-ml fresh f/2 medium with a salinity of 33 ppt and a pH of 8.0. Glass vials were incubated for 6 weeks at a temperature of 23°C, and irradiance was provided by white LEDs, providing a photon irradiance (400 to 700 nm) at ~100 µmol photons m¯² s¯¹ over a 14-hour/10-hour day/night cycle. This incubation period corresponded to approximately 14 to 17 generations in Symbiodinium CCMP2467. After this period, cells were carefully pipetted from the glass vials and centrifuged in 2-ml Eppendorf vials at 1500 rcf for 2 min to remove the supernatant. Cells were then pooled and placed onto microscopy slides with a sealing gasket (height, 500 µm), and their Fv/Fm values were measured every 90 s for 30 min in previously dark-adapted cells.",1

Videos were acquired in the cell-accumulated layer within approxi-mately 10 µm of the chamber surfaces, where motile cells tend to collect [40,41] and are generally aligned with the imaging plane. The large microchannel depth (10 times larger than the flagellar beat amplitude) ensured that motile cells were not arti-ficially confined. Outside of specialized cases [42], near surface swimming is not definitively known to affect flagellar dynamics. However, all cells were imaged under the same conditions consistent with copious works in the field [2,34], thus enabling comparative studies of cell motility. Additionally, no differences in cell dynamics were observed between the top and bottom of the chamber. Bull sperm kinematics were obtained from 250 frames s¯¹ video [27]. Cell heads and flagella were tracked to sub-pixel accuracy using in-house MATLAB (The Mathworks) routines (see the electronic supplementary material, table S1 for details). Briefly, raw images were background-subtracted, inverted and de-noised using a band-pass filter. Sperm heads and flagella were masked via intensity thresholding, and cell trajectories were constructed through a predictive particle tracking algorithm applied to the intensity weighted head centroids. A 5-point, second-order Savitzky-Golay filter was used to compute the instantaneous cell swimming speed. The flagellar centreline was defined by skeletonization of the flagellar image mask, followed by a Gaussian fit to the image intensity profile normal to the skel-eton every 1-4 pixels in arc length. Minor obscured portions of the flagellum were extrapolated using the second- or third-order para-metric polynomial fits. Finally, a parametric 5-point, second-order Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to both smooth the segmented flagellum and to compute the local flagellar curvature prior to shape mode analysis (see below). The curvature is defined as r(s) = (x*y* − y*x*)/(x^2 + y^2)3/2, where x and y are the coordinates of the flagellar segment located a distance (arc length), s, along the flagel-lum measured from head, and primes denote derivatives with respect to s.",1

In the following description of the ana-lyses, our goal was to extract a set of flagellar curvature basis modes, un, whose linear combination best describes the instan-taneous flagellar shapes (curvatures) taken on by a selected series of flagellar waveforms from a particular species. As a broad overview of the basis mode decomposition process, selected, instantaneous flagellar curvature vectors were concatenated into a flagellar curvature matrix, M. Flagellar basis modes, un, were then determined from the curvature matrix via singular value decomposition (SVD) in MATLAB. SVD is the modal decompo-sition that underlies common algorithms such as principal component analysis, which has been employed for shape and motility analyses of sperm and other organisms [24-26,28-31].

To mimic the dynamics of encounter with marine particles, four to five agarose spheres (~500 µm in diameter) loaded with 0.1% tryptone (Difco) were released into the cell suspension at 25-min intervals. Particles were preincubated in 0.1% tryptone solution for 1 h and then released into the system by using a particle release device made in-house.

Prior to the assays, cells were incubated for 3 h in unsupplemented seawater, while for the control experiment, cells were directly used after harvesting from the preculture (in tryptone-containing 2216 medium).

Perutz Laboratories, University of Vienna, under SPF conditions were sacrificed per experiment, and their colon was harvested anaerobically (85% N2, 10% CO2, 5% H2) in an anaerobic tent (Coy Laboratory Products, USA). Contents from each colon were suspended in 7.8 mL of 50% D₂O-containing PBS and homogenized by vortexing. Similar conditions have been successfully applied in the past to monitor activity of individual cells in gut communities without causing major changes in the activity of individual community members34. The homogenate was left to settle for 10 min, and the supernatant was then distributed into glass vials and supplemented with different concentrations of mucosal sugar monosaccharides, glucose, mucin or nothing (no-amendment control) (all amendment chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich, except D(+)-galactose which was purchased from Carl Roth GmbH) (Fig. 1a,c). After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C, glycerol was added (to achieve a final concentration of 20% (v/v) of glycerol in the microcosms) and the vials were crimp-sealed with rubber stoppers and stored at -80 °C until further processing. Prior to glycerol addition, subsamples of the biomass were collected, pelleted and supernatants stored at -80 °C for HILIC LC-MS/MS measurements. Pellets were washed with PBS to remove D₂O and were fixed in 3% formaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C and stored in 50% PBS/50% ethanol solution at -20 °C until further use. A total of three biological replicates were established using starting material pooled from three animals each (experiments MonoA, MonoB and MonoC). For the MonoA and MonoB experiments, microcosms were established for all the different concentrations of monosaccharides tested (Fig. 1c), while for MonoC only the highest concentrations of mono-saccharides tested in incubations MonoA and MonoB were supplemented. Note that analysis of mucin-amended sorted fractions has been published elsewhere35. Since mucin contains all the monosaccharides included in this study, it constitutes an important control, and therefore we processed the sequencing data from mucin sorts in parallel with our samples and included it in our analyses (Fig. 2).",1

Cell sorting was performed in a fully automated manner using a Raman microspectroscope (LabRAM HR800, Horiba Scientific, France) combined with optical tweezers and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic sorter. The optical tweezers (1,064 nm Nd:YAG laser at 500 mW) and Raman (532 nm Nd:YAG laser at 45 mW or 80 mW; see below) laser were focused at the same position of the interface between the sample and sheath streams using a single objective (63x, 1.2 NA water-immersion, Zeiss). The in-house software based on the graphical user interface (GUI; written in MATLAB) detected the single-cell capture and its deuterium labeling status by calculating the cell index (PC = 11,620-1,670/Ifluid,1,620-1,670; where I is the integrated intensity between the indicated wavenumbers) and the labeling index (PL = 12040-2300/11850-1900), respectively. We did not detect a significant change in the C-D peak region (2040-2300 cm-1) due the presence of 0.3 M of glycerol in the sorting fluid (added to minimize the osmotic stress when the sample was re-suspended for the RACS) (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Other spectral regions (e.g., <1500 cm-1 and >2700 cm-1) were slightly affected, but the sorting algorithm employed and the parameters described above take these small changes into account: the cell index PC (11620-1670/Ifluid,1620-1670) used to detect single-cell capture was calculated by comparing the Raman intensity of cells measured in real-time to that of the working fluid measured in the cali-bration (conducted before the actual sorting). The threshold value for PL (12040-2300/11850-1900) was chosen based on the measurement of the control sample (i.e., sample incubated in non-D2O-containing medium). We used two software versions, each of which uses 45 mW (version 1) and 80 mW (version 2) Raman laser powers, respectively. The second version operates with higher power based on the addition of a laser shutter that blocks the Raman laser while the cells are being translocated, reducing the laser-induced damage on the cell. This version allows shorter acquisition times to be employed, and therefore higher throughput of the platform. The laser power for each version was chosen based on visual inspection of captured cells as described35. For the NeuAc and GlcNAc-amendment sorts (version 1, since version 2 was not yet available), Pc value was calculated from cell spectra acquired for 2 s at the *capture location*, while the P₁ value was calculated from spectra obtained with a 5 s exposure time at the *evaluation location*. Fucose, GalNAc, and galactose-supplemented sorts were performed with version 2 of the platform, which in the meantime became available, significantly reducing sorting times. For these sorts both Pc and P₁ values were simultaneously measured at the *capture location* with a 0.3 s exposure time. Only the D-labeled cells were translocated to the *evaluation location* and immediately released. In order to determine the threshold P₁ above which a cell from the microcosms should be considered D-labeled (and therefore selected and sorted), cells from glucose-supplemented microcosms incubated in the absence or presence of D (0% versus 50% D₂O in the microcosms) were run on the platform prior to sorting. The threshold P₁ number can vary across microcosms due to different microbial compositions and/or physiological status of cells present in the starting material, as well as due to different laser powers employed. Therefore we determined the PL threshold separately for both MonoA and MonoB incubations using both 45 and 80 mW laser power. Nevertheless, we reached a P₁ threshold of 6.19 for all sets of conditions and incubations tested (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We speculate this was due to the identical conditions used in both incubations and the fact that both communities have a similar microbial composition (Fig. 1e). To test the sorting accuracy of the platform on our samples, the negative control (H₂O, glucose-supplemented microcosm) was re-run in the platform and sorted using the adopted threshold (P₁ = 6.19) (Supplementary Table 1). As expected, no cells were con-sidered labeled by the platform under these conditions. Sorted fractions were nevertheless collected and sequenced as controls.",1

For the NeuAc and GlcNAc-amendment sorts (version 1, since version 2 was not yet available), Pc value was calculated from cell spectra acquired for 2 s at the *capture location*, while the P₁ value was calculated from spectra obtained with a 5 s exposure time at the *evaluation location*. Fucose, GalNAc, and galactose-supplemented sorts were performed with version 2 of the platform, which in the meantime became available, significantly reducing sorting times. For these sorts both Pc and P₁ values were simultaneously measured at the *capture location* with a 0.3 s exposure time. Only the D-labeled cells were translocated to the *evaluation location* and immediately released. In order to determine the threshold P₁ above which a cell from the microcosms should be considered D-labeled (and therefore selected and sorted), cells from glucose-supplemented microcosms incubated in the absence or presence of D (0% versus 50% D₂O in the microcosms) were run on the platform prior to sorting. The threshold P₁ number can vary across microcosms due to different microbial compositions and/or physiological status of cells present in the starting material, as well as due to different laser powers employed. Therefore we determined the PL threshold separately for both MonoA and MonoB incubations using both 45 and 80 mW laser power. Nevertheless, we reached a P₁ threshold of 6.19 for all sets of conditions and incubations tested (Supplementary Fig. 2b). We speculate this was due to the identical conditions used in both incubations and the fact that both communities have a similar microbial composition (Fig. 1e). To test the sorting accuracy of the platform on our samples, the negative control (H₂O, glucose-supplemented microcosm) was re-run in the platform and sorted using the adopted threshold (P₁ = 6.19) (Supplementary Table 1). As expected, no cells were con-sidered labeled by the platform under these conditions. Sorted fractions were nevertheless collected and sequenced as controls.",1

Shotgun libraries were generated using the amplified DNA from WGA reactions (sorted fractions) or DNA isolated using the phenol-chloroform method (initial microcosms) as a template and Nextera XT (Illumina) reagents. Libraries were sequenced with a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) in 2 × 150 bp mode at the Biomedical Sequencing Facility, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

The quality and contamination of all MAGs were checked with CheckM 1.0.660 (Supplementary Data 1). MAGs >200 kb obtained from all samples were compared and de-replicated using dRep 1.4.362. Automatic genome annotation of contigs >2 kb within each de-replicated MAG was performed with RAST 2.063. Taxonomic classification of each MAG was obtained using GTDB-Tk64 (v0.1.3, gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). The relative abundance of each MAG on the initial microcosms was calculated based on metagenomic coverage. Filtered reads from each sequenced microcosm were mapped competitively against all retrieved MAGs using BBMap (https:// sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). Read coverage was normalized by genome size and relative abundances of each genome in each sample were calculated based on the formula: covA = (bpA/gA)/(bpT/gT), where cova is the relative abundance of MAG A on a particular sample, bpA is the number of base pairs from reads matching MAG A, gA is the genome length of MAG A, bpT is the total number of base pairs from reads matching all MAGs recovered from that particular sample and gt is the sum of all MAGs genome lengths. For determination of the presence of encoded enzymes for catabolism of mucin monosaccharides among MAGs, predicted protein sequences from recovered MAGs were subject to local BLASTP analyses65, against a custom database. The database was composed of all enzymes involved initial hydrolysis and catabolism of mucosal sugar monosaccharides (Supplementary Data 2), which were previously curated from a total of 395 human gut bacteria 15. A strict e-value threshold of 10-50 was used for all BLASTP analyses. During initial setup of the analysis pipeline, functional assignments of proteins that gave positive BLASTP hits were manually verified by examining annotations from RAST 2.0 and by performing BLASTP analyses against the NCBI-nr database (NCBIBlast 2.2.26). To verify the enrichment of a selected dataset of mucin-degrading enzymes35 in the assemblies derived from sorted fractions, BLASTX analyses of scaffolds from each fraction as well as from the initial microcosms metagenomes (unsorted) were performed against the selected mucin-degrading enzyme sequences15 (Supplementary Table 3).

Mass spectrometric analysis of eluted peptides where performed on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ltd., Harlow, UK) source in LC chip coupling mode. LC Gradient, ionization mode and mass spectrometry mode were performed as described before67. Briefly, peptide lysate were injected into a Nano-HPLC and trapped in a C18-reverse phase column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 µm × 2 cm, particle size 3 µM, nanoViper, Thermo Fisher) for 5 min.

The temperature of the separation column was set to 35 °C and the flow rate was 0.3 µL/min. The eluted peptides were ionized and measured. The MS was set to a full MS/dd-MS2 mode scan with positive polarity. The full MS scan was adjusted to 120,000 resolution, the automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 × 106 ions, maximum injection time for MS of 80 s and a scan range of 350 to 1550 m/z. The dd-MS2 scan was set to a resolution of 15,000 with the AGC target of 2 × 105 ions, a maximum injection time for 120 ms, TopN 20, isolation window of 1.6 m/z, scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z and a dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Raw data files were converted into mzML files and searched with MS-GF+ against a database obtained from microcosm metagenomes composed of 276,284 predicted protein-encoding sequences. The following parameters were used for peptide identification: enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with one missed cleavage allowed using 10 ppm peptide ion tolerance and 0.05 Da MS/MS tolerance. Oxidation (methionine) and carbamidomethylation (cysteine) were selected as modifications. False discovery rates (FDR) were determined with the node Percolator68.

PCR amplification was performed with a two-step barcoding approach53. In the first-step PCR, the 16S rRNA gene of most bacteria was targeted using oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary Table 7) containing head adaptors (5*-GCTATGCGCGAGCTGC-3*) in order to be barcoded in a second step PCR53. Barcode primers consisted of the 16 bp head sequence and a sample-specific 8 bp barcode from a previously published list at the 5* end. The barcoded amplicons were purified with the ZR-96 DNA Clean-up Kit (Zymo Research, USA) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA Assay (Invitrogen, USA). An equimolar library was constructed by pooling samples, and the resulting library was sent for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq platform at Microsynth AG (Balgach, Switzerland). Paired-end reads were quality-filtered and processed using QIIME 153,54. Reads were then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of 97% sequence identity and screened for chimeras using UPARSE implemented in USEARCH v8.1.186155. OTUs were classified using the RDPclassifier v2.1256 as implemented in Mothur v1.39.557 using the Silva database v13258.

Colonies were re-streak on the same medium plates until complete purity. Pure colonies were grown overnight in 10 mL of BHI medium (Brain heart infusion at 37 g per liter of medium) supplemented with: yeast extract, 5 g; Na2CO3, 42 mg; cysteine, 50 mg; vitamin K1, 1 mg; hemin, 10 µg.

Shotgun libraries were generated using the amplified DNA from WGA reactions (sorted fractions) or DNA isolated using the phenol-chloroform method (initial microcosms) as a template and Nextera XT (Illumina) reagents. Libraries were sequenced with a HiSeq 3000 (Illumina) in 2 × 150 bp mode at the Biomedical Sequencing Facility, Medical University of Vienna, Austria. The sequence reads were quality trimmed and filtered using BBMap v34.00 (https://sourceforge.net/projects/ bbmap/). The remaining reads were assembled de novo using SPAdes 3.11.159 in single-cell mode (k-mer sizes: 21, 35, 55). Binning of the assembled reads into metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) was performed with MetaBAT 2 (v2.12.1)61 using the following parameters: minContig 2000, minCV 1.0, minCVSum 1.0, maxP 95%, minS 60, and maxEdges 200. The quality and contamination of all MAGs were checked with CheckM 1.0.660 (Supplementary Data 1). MAGs >200 kb obtained from all samples were compared and de-replicated using dRep 1.4.362. Automatic genome annotation of contigs >2 kb within each de-replicated MAG was performed with RAST 2.063. Taxonomic classification of each MAG was obtained using GTDB-Tk64 (v0.1.3, gtdb.ecogenomic.org/). The relative abundance of each MAG on the initial microcosms was calculated based on metagenomic coverage. Filtered reads from each sequenced microcosm were mapped competitively against all retrieved MAGs using BBMap (https:// sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/). Read coverage was normalized by genome size and relative abundances of each genome in each sample were calculated based on the formula: covA = (bpA/gA)/(bpT/gT), where cova is the relative abundance of MAG A on a particular sample, bpA is the number of base pairs from reads matching MAG A, gA is the genome length of MAG A, bpT is the total number of base pairs from reads matching all MAGs recovered from that particular sample and gt is the sum of all MAGs genome lengths. For determination of the presence of encoded enzymes for catabolism of mucin monosaccharides among MAGs, predicted protein sequences from recovered MAGs were subject to local BLASTP analyses65, against a custom database. The database was composed of all enzymes involved initial hydrolysis and catabolism of mucosal sugar monosaccharides (Supplementary Data 2), which were previously curated from a total of 395 human gut bacteria 15. A strict e-value threshold of 10-50 was used for all BLASTP analyses. During initial setup of the analysis pipeline, functional assignments of proteins that gave positive BLASTP hits were manually verified by examining annotations from RAST 2.0 and by performing BLASTP analyses against the NCBI-nr database (NCBIBlast 2.2.26). To verify the enrichment of a selected dataset of mucin-degrading enzymes35 in the assemblies derived from sorted fractions, BLASTX analyses of scaffolds from each fraction as well as from the initial microcosms metagenomes (unsorted) were performed against the selected mucin-degrading enzyme sequences15 (Supplementary Table 3).

Protein lysates were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel tryptic digestion. Proteins were stained with colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G- 250 (Roth, Kassel, Germany) and detained with Aqua dest. Whole protein bands were cut into gel pieces and in-gel-digestion with trypsin 30 µL (0.005 µg/µL) was performed overnight. Extracted peptides where dried and resolved in 0.1% formic acid and purified by ZipTip treatment (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). In total, 5 µg of peptides were injected into nanoHPLC (UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientific), followed by separation on a C18- reverse phase trapping column (C18 PepMap100, 300 µm × 5 mm, particle size 5 µm, nano viper, Thermo Fischer Scientific), followed by separation on a C18- reverse phase analytical column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 µm × 25 cm, particle size 3 µm, nanoViper, Thermo Fischer Scientific). Mass spectrometric analysis of eluted peptides where performed on a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ltd., Harlow, UK) source in LC chip coupling mode. LC Gradient, ionization mode and mass spectrometry mode were performed as described before67. Briefly, peptide lysate were injected into a Nano-HPLC and trapped in a C18-reverse phase column (Acclaim PepMap 100, 75 µm × 2 cm, particle size 3 µM, nanoViper, Thermo Fisher) for 5 min. Peptide separation was followed by a two-step gradient in 90 min from 4 to 30% of B (B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in MS-grade water) and then 30 min from 30 to 55% of B. The temperature of the separation column was set to 35 °C and the flow rate was 0.3 µL/min. The eluted peptides were ionized and measured. The MS was set to a full MS/dd-MS2 mode scan with positive polarity. The full MS scan was adjusted to 120,000 resolution, the automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3 × 106 ions, maximum injection time for MS of 80 s and a scan range of 350 to 1550 m/z. The dd-MS2 scan was set to a resolution of 15,000 with the AGC target of 2 × 105 ions, a maximum injection time for 120 ms, TopN 20, isolation window of 1.6 m/z, scan range of 200 to 2000 m/z and a dynamic exclusion of 30 s. Raw data files were converted into mzML files and searched with MS-GF + against a database obtained from microcosm metagenomes composed of 276,284 predicted protein-encoding sequences. The following parameters were used for peptide identification: enzyme specificity was set to trypsin with one missed cleavage allowed using 10 ppm peptide ion tolerance and 0.05 Da MS/MS tolerance. Oxidation (methionine) and carbamidomethylation (cysteine) were selected as modifications. False discovery rates (FDR) were determined with the node Percolator68. Proteins were considered as identified when at least one unique peptide passed a FDR of 5%. The MetaProSIP toolshed69 embedded in the Galaxy framework70 (v2.3.2, http://galaxyproject.org/) was used to identify the incorporation of stable isotopes into peptides. MetaProSIP calculates the relative isotope abundance (RIA) on detected isotopic mass traces (m/z tolerance of ±10 ppm, intensity threshold of 1000, and an isotopic trace correlation threshold of 0.7).",1

Το wash particles before use, particle suspensions were diluted with an aqueous solution of TWEEN 20 (Sigma Aldrich; 0.015% v/v) to a final concentration of 0.1% v/v and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was then gently removed with a pipette and replaced with an aqueous solution of TWEEN 20 (Sigma Aldrich; 0.015% v/v). This procedure was repeated three times to ensure complete replacement of the supplier*s solvent. All suspensions used for particle assembly had a particle concentration of 0.1% v/v and TWEEN 20 concentration of 0.015% v/v. This surfactant concentration enables an optimal receding contact angle between 30° and 60° during deposition (ESI,† Fig. S1). As proof of concept for in situ surface functionalization, polystyrene particles with covalently bound streptavidin on the surface (Micromer® 01-19-203; Micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) were exposed to fluorescent biotin using a solution of 10 µM biotin dye (Atto 520-Biotin, Merck) in 10 mM PBS buffer (Gibco PBS pH 7.4 (1x)).",1

Features were designed in the open-source software Klayout. A chrome-glass mask with a layer of positive photoresist (AZ1505, MicroChemicals) was prepared by exposing the designed features with a UV direct laser writer (Heidelberg DWL 2000) and developed with a spin developer (OPTIspin SB20) using AZ400K developer (MicroChemicals) at 1:4 photoresist to water ratio for 15 s, then immersed in chrome etchant for 50 s (Techni Etch Cr01, Technic France). A 10 cm silicon wafer (N/Phos <100> 1-10 Ω cm, silicon materials) was plasma treated for 3 min at 600 W (Gigabatch 310 M PVA TePla) and a layer of hexamethyldisilazane was vapor-deposited and baked at 110 °C to increase the adhesion towards the photoresist. A layer of AZ1505 photoresist was then deposited at 2000 rpm for 2 min and the features were exposed to UV through the chrome-glass mask with a mask aligner (Süss MA6) at 20 mJ for 2 s and developed with AZ400K developer as for the mask. To complete the fabrication of the silicon master, the wafer was etched via deep reactive ion exchange (Alcatel AMS 200SE I-Speeder) adjusting the etching time (<2 min) to achieve the desired depth (measured with a profilometer; Veeco Dektak 6 M). To prepare the particle deposition template, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer kit, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) was mixed with cross-linker (10% by weight) and degassed, then 3 g was poured onto the silicon master. To obtain a 400 µm-thick layer, PDMS was spin coated at 500 rpm for 5 s and at 800 rpm for 10 s, then degassed again to remove trapped air bubbles. The silicon wafer was baked at 70 °C for 2 h, after which the PDMS template layer was peeled off and was ready to be bonded to the PDMS channel. The templates used for colloidal patterning had dimensions of 10 mm × 5 mm, accommodating ~106 traps. Traps large enough to accommodate two adjacent particles were 2 µm long, 1 μm wide, and 500 nm deep (Fig. 3A) for the green and red PS particles of 1.02 µm diameter, and 4 µm long, 2 µm wide, and 1 µm deep (Fig. 3B) for the green and red particles of 2 µm diameter. Traps large enough to accommodate three adjacent particles (Fig. 3C), or two particles at the extremities of the traps (Fig. 3D), were 4 µm long, 1 µm wide, and 500 nm deep, for the green and red PS particles of 1.02 µm diameter. The separation between the traps is at least twice greater than the width of the trap along the direction of the moving meniscus, to ensure that the contact line sequentially dewets traps within a single row and that different rows are sequentially dewetted, in order to maintain a well-controlled motion of the meniscus.",1

The two side sections are each 5 mm wide, and 1 mm high, and the central section is 7 mm wide and 500 µm high. There is no physical barrier between the three sections. The shallowest part of the microfluidic channel is located above the template, namely, the region of the channel floor bearing the microfabricated traps.

Once the liquid has covered the template region that sits on the bottom of the channel (see the supporting information for details of the filling procedure), it is withdrawn and, once the accumulation zone (as defined later) is formed, particles start being deposited. The liquid withdrawal speed of the syringe pump (CETONI Base 120, CETONI GmbH) was set at a flow rate such that the meniscus moves at a constant speed of 1-2 µm s-1 during deposition. The control module, a heated glass plate equipped with a controller (H601-NIKON-TS2R-GLASS and H401-T-CONTROLLER, Okolab), is placed below the microfluidic channel to maintain a temperature of 27-30 °C.

Cells were cultured in 50-mL sterile glass tubes under a diel light cycle (14 h light: 10 h dark; 75 µmol photons m¯² · s¯¹) in f/2 (minus silica) medium, at 21 °C (CCMP452) or 18 °C (CCMP3374). For propagation of the cell cultures, 2 mL of the parent culture was inoculated into 25 mL of fresh medium every 2 wk. Experiments with CCMP452 were carried out with monoclonal cell cultures that were grown from a single parent cell isolated using an inoculation loop (diameter of ~100 µm) developed in-house. The loop was dipped into a culture to trap a thin liquid layer, and microscopy was used to select the cases with only a single CCMP452 in the layer. Each individual cell was transferred to a separate well in a 36-well plate containing fresh growth medium. Experiments were conducted between 96 h and 120 h after inoculation, which corresponds to the early exponential growth phase of CCMP452 (16) at room temperature (21 °C). A fixed period of the day (between the hours of 09:00 and 15:00) was chosen for the experiments to rule out any possible artifacts due to the diurnal migration pattern of many phytoplankton species, including H. akashiwo (16, 48). For the experiments to test the effect of scavengers on the oxidative stress-induced split, CCMP452 cells were grown with KI, an H2O2 scavenger (49, 50). Cells in preliminary trials were grown in suspensions containing a range of KI concentrations: 1 μΜ, 10 μΜ, 100 μΜ, and 1 mM. All scavenging experiments reported here were performed with the 100-µM KI concentration. At this concentration, the growth rate, vertical distribution, and swimming speed of CCMP452 cells matched those of the control cell culture (cells grown without KI) in the absence of turbulence treatments. To study the long-term impact of turbulent cues on growth rates, both the top and bottom subpopulations of CCMP452 were harvested (300 µL each) from a 2-mL cell culture vial that had been exposed to turbulent cues in the form of rolling for 5 min (SI Appendix, Generation of turbulent cues, (ii) Rolling).",1

CM-H2DCFDA is a chloromethyl derivative of H2DCFDA that enables the detection of low concentrations of ROS. The marker is a suitable indicator for long-term quantification of ROS as it passively diffuses into live cells and forms a highly stable fluorescent adduct when oxidized. After the 30-min incubation period, fluorescence intensities of single cells were quantified using a flow cytometer (CytoFLEX S, Beckman Coulter), in the FITC-A channel (Ex/Em: ~488/520 nm). Single-cell oxidative stress levels are represented as (relative) fluorescence units. To obtain the stress levels, we subtracted the FITC-A values for the control in the absence of CM-H2DCFDA staining from the FITC-A values for the stained cells. This additional step ensured the subtraction from the stress measurement of the autofluorescence of H. akashiwo over the green portion of the spectrum, characteristic of raphidophytes (51). Fluorescence levels were obtained for the turbulence-exposed population for the top and bottom subpopulations and for the control population (no turbulence) with and without the addition of CM-H2DCFDA.",1

For PAM measurements, cells were placed into one of the channels of a prefabricated glass-bottom microfluidic chamber with a depth of 100 µm (Ibidi µ-Slide VI, Ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany). Using the saturation pulse method (40, 53), which is based on recording fluorescence yields before and during a saturating light pulse, the maximum quantum yield of photosynthetic energy conversion in PS II, Fv/Fm = (Fm - Fo)/Fm, was measured after a 15-min dark incubation. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400 to 700 nm) was provided by coalescing red, green and blue (RGB) light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which were calibrated before each experiment using a PAR light-sensor (MC-MQS micro quantum sensor, Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) connected to a universal light meter (ULM-500, Walz).

For gravitactic cells characterized by a stability parameter A swimming at low Reynolds numbers in a fluid under solid body rotation in the vertical plane at a constant rotation rate Ω = π/τR (rad s¯¹), which here exemplifies the characteristic reorientation rate 1/TK by Kolmogorov-scale turbulent eddies in the ocean, the equation of motion in the laboratory frame of reference reads de/dt = -Asine + Ω, [1] where measures the cell orientation to the vertical (SI Appendix, Figs. S1C and S2A). We have used the relation between the vorticity and the rotation rate for a fluid in a continuous (clockwise) solid body rotation in the vertical plane performed by the flipping chamber (and the rolling device), with the strain rate set to E = 0 (26). A gravitactic cell may therefore swim at a nonzero angle deq = arcsin(ΩΑ¯¹) for upward-migrating cells (and leq = π arcsin(ΩΑ¯¹) for downward-migrating cells) relative to the vertical if | < |A| with 0 < θεα < π/2, or it may tumble if & is sufficiently large (Ω > |A|) and thus perform a periodic orbit with period Тв = 2π(22-Α2)-1/2, [2] where B = (2A)¯¹ is the stability timescale (19). The solutions for Eq. 1 are portrayed in SI Appendix, Fig. S1C (2 = 0.2 rad s¯¹) for two different stability parameters corresponding to the two strains CCMP452 (low stability, where cells tumble) and CCMP3374 (high stability, where cells swim at an equilibrium angle deq). By applying the condition for tumbling |2| > |A| for the distribution of the stability parameter fa, measured experimentally (Fig. 1E), the fraction of cells migrating upward f₁ and downward f₁ can be extracted (SI Appendix), where we assumed, based on the saturation of the behavioral response after 10 flips only (Fig. 1C), that all tumbling cells undertake the switch in the migratory direction. We can then derive the upward bias r as a function of the rotation time TR of the chamber. The result of this stability analysis is plotted in Fig. 1D (black dashed line).",1

An effect of rotation is that the gravitational acceleration g appears to be rotating in the rotating frame of reference. During a tumbling event, we assumed that intracellular stress is generated in the cell in the form of a nearly instantaneous release (i.e., a spike) of ROS whenever the cell is being reoriented relative to gravity (SI Appendix). In our model, the ROS spike specifically occurs at times t; whenever the cell swims in a direction 0 = π/2, that is, in the direction perpendicular to the gravity vector. This particular choice of swimming direction is arbitrary, and we could choose any value between π/2 < θ < π without changing our results. The intracellular scavenging machinery of the cells dissipates the accumulated stress s with a characteristic timescale τς (measured experimentally, Fig. 3B and SI Appendix). The resulting intracellular stress accumulation-dissipation dynamics are captured by the following differential equation ds/dt = s;6(t − t;)-st¹ + Co, [3] where the Dirac delta function 8(t – t;) records the stress spikes As; (assumed to all have the same value As) occurring at times t; for a given swimming trajectory and co is the baseline stress rate. Eq. 3 can be solved by performing the Laplace transform, which gives the stress level as a function of time s(t) = ∑∆se(t − t;)e-(t-tits + So, [4] where (tti) is the Heaviside function and So = Co τς is the baseline stress level before the fluid rotation. The population stress levels were measured with a flow cytometer for controls (no rotations) and after rolling (Fig. 2 A and B). By taking the partial sum in the summation in Eq. 4, the upper envelope of the stress signal over time experienced by the tumbling cells after N periodic reorientations is Smax(t) = As (1-e-Tas) (1-e-TB51) + So, [5] where the sequence of times t; at which stress is generated is S = {ТВ/...іТв....NTB}. TB is the period of the orbit for the tumbling cells given in Eq. 2, which depends on the stability parameter A and on the rotation rate Ω. In SI Appendix, Supplementary Text, we further model the stress dynamics for cells exposed to turbulent cues for the two paradigmatic cases that we employed experimentally: 1) a continuous solid body rotation (i.e., rolling) with rotation rate 2 = π/TR (no resting phases, tw = 0), and 2) multiple, fast reorientations of amplitude π (i.e., flipping) occurring at a rate 2 >> A, alternating with resting phases captured by the timescale tw (Fig. 1B). To take into account population heterogeneity in the mechanical stability and stress dissipation parameters observed experimentally, we also derived a stochastic model of stress dynamics under rolling and flipping (SI Appendix).",1

Lysogeny broth (LB) composed of tryptone (10 g/L), yeast extract (5 g/L), and NaCl (10 g/L) was used for all microfluidic nutrient conditions. For the microfluidic experiments, the same stock solution of 100% LB was mixed with an equimolar NaCl solution (2.5 g NaCl in 250 mL 0.22 µm filtered water; Millipore Millipak Express 40, catalog no. MPGP04001) to prepare three dilutions: low, average, and high. To avoid bubble formation within the microfluidics, the NaCl solution was freshly autoclaved the day of each experiment and then cooled before preparing the LB dilutions. The high LB (2%) mixed 2 mL of the full LB into 98 mL salt solution. The low LB (0.1%) mixed 5 mL of the high LB solution with 95 mL salt solution. Afterward, the high LB solution was labeled with 0.26 nM sodium fluorescein, to allow visual calibration of switching between media. All solutions were adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH. Equal parts of low and high LB were mixed to produce the average LB control; hence, the average LB medium contained 0.13 nM sodium fluorescein. This fluorescein addition had no effect on the growth rate (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Furthermore, we confirmed with metabolomic profiling that the different steady-state growth rates between the three steady conditions resulted from concentration-dependent changes in nutrient uptake rates, rather than changes in preferential metabolite uptake (Supplementary Fig. 6).

To determine whether the preferred nutrient sources in our microfluidics experiments differed with nutrient concentration, we measured the depletion of extracellular metabolites from batch cultures. Batch cultures were necessary to observe metabolite depletion by enabling higher cell densities per volume. Measurements of depletion from the earliest time points after inoculating the batch cultures (i.e., when the media composition was least changed) best represented the nutrient consumption in microfluidic conditions, which continuously replenished all metabolites. We collected the supernatant from 20 mL batch cultures grown at 37 °C with shaking in 125 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. Twelve flasks were prepared in parallel, four of each nutrient concentration (Clow, Cave, and Chigh). Three of each concentration were inoculated with cells, while the fourth flask was kept bacteria-free and sampled as a blank control. The inoculum was prepared with the same overnight and seed culture preparation used for the microfluidics experiments (see Cell preparation). Once the seed culture reached an OD600 of 0.1 (grown in MOPS medium with 0.2% glucose), nine 1 mL aliquots were centrifuged for 2 min at 2500 r.c.f. (Eppendorf, Centrifuge 5424R) and the MOPS-based supernatant was removed. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in the final growth medium (Clow, Caves or Chigh) and then inoculated into the appropriate flask. Each flask was sampled every 30 min by centrifuging 500 µL of culture for 5 min at 2500 r.c.f. Then, 100 µL of supernatant was removed from the top of each tube and stored in a 96-well plate (Thermo Scientific). Samples were kept on ice when in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes (Sarstedt AG & Co.), and then at -20 °C when in the plate. The samples were thawed and diluted 1:10 in milliQ water prior to direct injection and were measured with flow-injection time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Untargeted metabolomics measurements were performed with a binary LC pump (Agilent Technologies) and an MPS2 Autosampler (Gerstel) coupled to an Agilent 6520 time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) operated in negative mode, at 4 Ghz, high resolution, with an m/z (mass/charge) range of 50-100047. The mobile phase consisted of isopropanol:water (60:40, v/v) with 5 mM ammonium fluoride buffer at pH 9 at a flow rate of 150 µl/min. Raw data were processed and analyzed with preprocessing raw mass spectrometry data functions contained in the bioinformatics toolbox of Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick) 47. Overall, we detected 7037 ions, of which 284 could be annotated against the KEGG database (restricted to E. coli) with 0.003 Da tolerance. We monitored the depletion of these 284 metabolites over time in batch cultures inoculated into Cave or Chigh. We found that detectable metabolites displayed comparable dynamics in the two nutrient concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 6). This suggests that the different growth rates observed among nutrient concentrations arise from differences in nutrient flux and not from differences in the composition of nutrient consumed. Metabolites in Clow were below the detection limit.",1

To switch between media, we oscillated pressure within each reservoir of the nutrient medium while maintaining a steady mean pressure to ensure a steady total flow rate of the medium through the device (Supplementary Fig. 1). This flow rate was determined by collecting the fluid output from the MSG and measuring the volume per minute. While the pressure differentials across the setup can vary (e.g., different device, slight variations in tubing lengths and angles), the range of flow rates used had no effect on growth rate (Supplementary Fig. 2). Because the pressure differentials could vary from day to day, the pressure differences required to completely switch between media were calibrated prior to each experiment at ×20 magnification, which enabled visualization of the entire signal junction (Supplementary Fig. 1). These calibrated pressure differences were then used to define the fluctuating nutrient signal. The pressure system was programmed to generate the signal in synchrony with image acquisition. Thus, timestamps from the image data could be directly correlated with specific time points within the nutrient signal. Separately, the stability of the calibrated signals was visually confirmed by comparing the fluorescent signal exiting the junction with the signal observed downstream (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 3). These visualizations were conducted at ×60 magnification and quantified by custom image processing scripts in MATLAB (see Code availability).",1

Two positions in the MSG were imaged while the fluid flowing through fluctuated between a medium labeled with 0.26 nM sodium fluorescein and an unlabeled medium on a 30 s period. Specifically, we compared the sharpness of the signal immediately upon generation with that observed further downstream, as experienced by the surface-attached cells, and observed virtually no decay in the fluorescent signal between the signal junction and the imaging region (Supplementary Fig. 3), only the time delay as calculated in Supplementary Table 1. While no fluid mixing occurs in this device-we operate under laminar flow regimes and there is no Lagrangian mixing-the diffusion of nutrients (or sodium fluorescein, which is 2-4 times the molecular weight of an amino acid) could potentially smooth out our nutrient signal. Diffusion can be further aided by Taylor dispersion, a phenomenon in which velocity gradients in the fluid flow (i.e., shear) work to increase the effective diffusion of a chemical species by spreading it across a larger region, thereby favoring diffusion. Were the magnitude of these effects non-negligible in our system, we should expect different slopes during transitions between the signals at the junction and downstream. Specifically, the downstream signal should have a longer transition time as we would detect fluorescence leaching into the Clow phases of the signal. However, the time required to complete transitions (i.e., time to go from baseline to saturated fluor-escent signal and vice versa) was about 2 s in both locations (Supplementary Fig. 3). Thus, our flow rates are sufficiently fast to carry our intended signal across the entire length of the device without noticeable smoothing from diffusion. We also deter-mined that the periodic oscillations in the nutrient signal are robust across time. The programmed period (T= 30 s) was reliably quantified between peaks and between troughs from the repetitive fluorescein signal (Supplementary Fig. 3).",1

The compressed air is fed into the pressure system through a manual regulator, which caps the pressure directed toward the two automated regulators at 1.5 psi. To ensure that the automated regulators receive a stable input, the pressure of the compressed air source is higher than this maximum value. Each automated regulator is connected to and modulates the internal pressure of one reservoir of nutrient medium (Chigh or Clow). Each nutrient reservoir is a septum-capped glass vial (vials: VWR, cat. no. 548-0154; caps: VWR, cat. no. 548-0872) with two needles inserted into the silica septum: one short and one long. The short needle directly connects an automated pressure regulator with the air space within its reservoir, thereby adjusting the pressure within the reservoir as dictated by the MATLAB signal (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The long needle connects the fluid within its reservoir with the microchannel via tubing inserted into the inlets of the device (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The microscope and media are contained within a custom LIS incubator, which maintains the sample and all media at 37 °C. Experiments were based on the exposure of cells attached to the lower surface of the microchannels to precisely controlled fluctuating or steady nutrient conditions, and the imaging of thousands of cells in the downstream imaging region in order to calculate their individual growth rates. The treated, dry microchannels were inoculated with ~50 µL of the seed culture (see Cell Preparation) for 10-15 min, allowing cells to settle and attach to the glass surface within each microchannel before the flow was established. Prior to inoculation, the microfluidic device was placed in a vacuum for at least 10 min to remove air from the PDMS. This step helped to avoid the presence of bubbles inside the channels, by removing air from the PDMS so that any air introduced in the setup would be absorbed by the PDMS. Inputs to fluctuating conditions were two septum-capped glass vials (one each for high and low nutrient) from which flow was driven by a custom-built air pressure system (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Inputs to steady conditions were 10 mL plastic syringes (Codan) from which flow was driven by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). Outputs for all conditions led to liquid waste receptacles. To avoid changes in pressure throughout experiments, we ensured that the waste tubing was sufficiently short to never become submerged by the rising level of media waste.",1

This magnification was high enough to detect changes in growth between each image, yet low enough to image hundreds of cells per field of view. Each position was repeatedly imaged every 117 s (1:57 min), a time step sufficiently short to allow the acquisition of multiple time points along a growth curve (i.e., 10 time points in a 20 min cell cycle), yet infrequent enough to image a total of 40-50 positions within each time step. Imaging 10-15 positions within each of four parallel conditions (i.e., fluctuating and steady Clow, Caves and Chigh) required roughly 1.5 min. Generally, ten imaging positions per condition allowed us to track 500-1000 or more cells per nutrient condition. We confirmed that growth rates were independent of a cell*s position along the 10-mm-long region imaged within the microchannel (Supplementary Fig. 4) and therefore that cells experienced identical nutrient time series, regardless of location within the microchannel. The uneven time step (1:57 min as opposed to 2:00 min) was chosen to avoid potential aliasing effects, by sampling at various points along the nutrient period instead of repeatedly at the same few. Light exposure was limited to 20 ms per image, with the shutter only open during image capture. Image acquisition was fully automated through Nikon Elements, supplemented with the Nikon Perfect Focus System to prevent loss of focus due to vertical shifts in the sample.",1

First, a custom MATLAB particle tracking pipeline was developed to (1) read image data directly from Nikon Elements image files, (2) identify particles based on pixel intensity, (3) fit an ellipse to each particle and measure particle parameters (e.g., length, width) and (4) track individual particles through time. Second, to exclude errors from our analysis-for example, particles arising from noise (i.e., non-uniformity in the background) or particles that include more than one cell-a quality control step trimmed our tracked dataset, using size criteria and noise filters to exclude errors. The parameter values used in both steps ensured that 93-97% (depending on nutrient condition) of tracks derive from isolated single cells. The final output of these two steps is a data matrix containing parameter data (e.g., cell length) over time for hundreds of individual cells growing in isolation. Reducing our analysis to cells without neighbors allowed us to assume no accumulation or depletion of medium components, and no physical interactions between cells. Cells in contact were excluded from the analysis to avoid the possibility of metabolic interactions and imprecision in the measurement of cell size. Specifics regarding the particle tracking and quality control steps are available in the scripts (see Code availability). Images in figure panels were adjusted for visualization using Fiji49.",1

One widely used method to calculate growth rate is to consider single-cell growth an exponential process12,48 and solve for instantaneous growth rate, μ. This definition of growth rate is used throughout this study. From the length and width measured during particle tracking, the instantaneous volume of each individual cell was approximated as a cylinder with hemispherical caps19. The approximated volumes were then used to compute instantaneous single-cell growth rates in terms of volume doublings per hour. Using V(t + At) = V(t) × 2µΔt, we calculated u between each pair of time steps, with Δt = 117 s (imaging frame rate). Specifically, we took the natural logarithm of each volume trajectory and calculated the slope between each point. Dividing the slope by the natural log of 2 changes the base of the exponential from e to 2. Thus, μ represents the exponential rate at which volume doubles. Accounting for day-to-day variability in growth rate. While steady-state growth rates were generally reproducible (Supplementary Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 6), we found that growth rate measurements performed on the same day (i.e., same seed culture) were moderately correlated (Supplementary Table 7). This correlation indi-cates that slight differences between the seed culture (which was different for each experiment) contributed to the differences in growth rate measured from identical conditions between experiments. Thus, when comparing growth rate across condi-tions (e.g., Gfluc and Gave), we compared measurements performed on the same day before comparing between experimental replicates, calculating the fraction of Gave represented by the measured Gfluc from that same experiment before calculating statistics (i.e., mean and standard deviation of Gfluc/Gave) across experiments. We used this same approach when comparing Gfluc to GJ, which was calculated from each experiment*s Glow and Ghigh, and Gfluc to Glow. The alternative approach for this comparison would be to calculate the mean and standard deviation between experimental replicates before calculating fractions (e.g., Gfluc/Gave) and combining the error. Numerically, this alternative approach yields very similar results. Reporting summary.

A surface-tethered, large-diameter net trap with a 0.2 µm mesh covered cod end15 was deployed at 150 m for 24 h at approximately 32°7*N 64°23*W. At the end of the deployment, the trap was sealed remotely by acoustic release and recovered. The particulate material collected in the cod end was suspended by gentle shaking, screened to remove particles and organisms of greater than 350 µm, and quantitatively split using an eight-way electronic rotating splitter.16 Splits were allowed to settle at in situ temperature for 30 min in the dark, and the particulate material was aspirated into a Petri dish. The dense suspension was diluted with filtered seawater (0.2 µm poresize), and particles were hand-picked under a Zeiss Stemi 508 stereomicroscope using a 5 µL capillary. Picked particles were placed into a 96-well plate in a minimum volume (approximately 1-2 µL) of the seawater medium and imaged at 50x magnification, with the exception of very large marine snow type aggregates, which were imaged at 6.5X. An additional 5 µL of filtered seawater, collected in situ, was added to each well, and the plate was stored at -80 °C until extraction.",1

Six complete methodological blanks were used to subtract background signals in all of the samples of sinking POM. We observed that chlorophyll a was quantitatively transformed into pheophytin a prior to analysis, presumably due to the nature of the loading solvents; we report simply *pheophytin a*, recognizing that, particularly in the diatom cells, chlorophyll a was likely the dominant contributor to this signal. None of the other lipid standards degraded. In our previous work on sterols and wax esters, we reported only summed concentrations for these two classes.

P. aeruginosa suspensions were prepared by inoculating 3 mL tryptone broth (TB; 10 g/L tryptone) with cells from a single colony and incubating for 3 h at 37 °C, while shaking at 200 rpm. The suspensions were then diluted in fresh TB to final optical density at 600 nm (OD600) < 0.01. eDNA and Pel quantities were visualized and measured using fluorescence staining methods: for eDNA visualization, PI (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the medium to a final concentration of 2 µg/mL, and for Pel visualization WFL (bio- World) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL. When Pel and eDNA were visualized simultaneously on the same streamer, WFL was flown for 30 min, images were captured, and only thereafter staining with Pl was performed. This protocol (35, 66) allowed visualization of the two components on the same streamer, while avoiding possible interactions between the two stains. For experiments involving different pH values, we adjusted pH to 5.8 by adding HCl and to 7.8 by adding NaOH to the culture media.

Levine",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Methods,"This model captures key micro-scale dynamics occurring on particulate organic carbon (POC) in a manner scalable to the water column. For the results presented in the main text, we represent particle-associated microbial diversity using 18 groups of heterotrophic microbes, defined based on their enzyme kinetics and growth rates. Supplementary Material 2 presents a sensitivity test with a continuum of microbial classes and demonstrates that this discretization does not impact our results. We also make the simplifying assumption that each particle type consists of a single lability of organic carbon colonized by a single type of microbial primary degrader, though the conclusions of this work are not dependent on this assumption (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material 2). Here we track each unique particle type i, which is defined based on radius at formation and lability (β;). We include enzymatic degradation of polymer into low molecular weight organic matter (Clmwom), density dependent growth of the particle- associated microbial community (B₁), and the attachment (E₁₂) and detachment (L₁) of heterotrophic microbes to/from the particles. This model can be coupled to a full ecosystem model such that the generation of each particle type can be calculated prognostically. However, here we focus on the degradation of POC below the export depth and so simply include a source term to represent net particle formation above the export depth (default 100 m, see Supplementary Material 2 for simulations with alternative formation depths). For simplicity, we also do not allow for aggregation or disaggregation to occur within the water column. An extended model description is provided in Supplementary Material 1. The change in the carbon content of particle i (Cpoc,is mmol CPOC particle-1) over time is defined as: dCpoc,i/dt = -β₁B (1) where ẞ; (mmol CPOC mmol Ccell 1 day-1) represents the polymer degradation rate of Cpoc,i by microbial group B; (mmol Ccell particle-1) similar to59. Specifically, ẞ; captures differences in *lability* of particles, which is a function the organic carbon itself, the microbial enzymes specific to group B₁, and production rate of those enzymes by B₁. When the particle is fully consumed (Cpoc=0), the particle- associated microbial community detaches and so consumption stops. The enzymatic degradation of POC results in the production of low molecular weight organic matter (LMWOM) (Clmwom, mmol Cm-3 particle-1) which sup- ports microbial growth. We assume that there is no loss of carbon during the enzymatic cleavage from POC to LMWOM such that 1 mmol Cpoc degraded = 1",1

The equations of motion of an ellipsoidal swimmer in a 2D flow directed along the x axis are:  x = Vcos (4) + u (y)  y = V sin($)  1-q²  1 ди (у)  1 +  cos (24) + R (t)  $ =   2 ду  2(1+ q²)  where V is the bacterial swimming velocity, directed along the cell major axis, u(y) is the flow speed inside the channel, φ is the angle between the major axis of the cell and the direction of flow, and ξR (t) describes the angular deviations due to thermal noise and the specific bacterial swimming pattern. Here, P. aeruginosa cells were modeled as prolate ellipsoids with an effective aspect ratio q = 9.4 [29] and the swimming velocity V was set according to the values measured in our motility assays. We numerically integrated the equations of motion for 105 cells with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta scheme implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks) with time step ∆t = 4 ms. In order to take into account the run-reverse-pause motility of P. aeruginosa, we integrated the equations of motion for a number of time steps equal to trun/∆t by modeling ξR (t) as the thermal rotational noise described by a Gaussian-distributed angular velocity with zero mean and variance 2Drot/∆t, where Drot = 0.0014 rad²/s is the Brownian rotational diffusion coefficient of a cell with aspect ratio q = 9.4 and a width of 1 µm. After every trun/∆t steps, we modeled the reverse-pause events by adding a random angular deviation ∆φ drawn by the angular distributions measured experimentally. The results did not change significantly when considering the Brownian rotational diffusion coefficient of a cell without taking the flagellum into account (aspect ratio q = 2, Drot ≈ 0.05 rad²/s). In the case of Newtonian fluids flowing in a straight channel, we considered a parabolic velocity profile u(y) = U[1-4(y/W)²], where U is the maximum flow speed, and a shear rate profile j(y) = ди(y)/ду = −8Uy/W². To simulate the Newtonian flow in a serpentine channel as the one used in the experiments, we first characterized the three-dimensional (3D) flow in the channel curves with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics). Then, we numerically integrated Eq. 1 by alternating sections with the velocity and shear rate profiles of the 4 cm-long straight sections and sections mimicking the curves to the left or to the right, according to the channel geometry. The length of the sections mimicking the curves was set to (R + W/2)π and the corresponding velocity and shear rate profiles were assumed to be equal to those computed on the channel midplane at the center of a curve. In the non-Newtonian case, we first characterized the 3D flow of the 0.1 w/v% xanthan gum solution inside the microchannel with CFD simulations. We then used the resulting 2D velocity and shear rate profiles on the midplane to integrate the equations of motion in Eq. 1. To simulate the rheological behavior of the xanthan gum solution, we set the fluid consistency index to m = 17.8 mPas and the flow behavior index to n = 0.65, according to our rheological measurements (Figure 1C). We set the lower shear rate limit to jmin = 0.00188 s-1. According to the shear-thinning behavior of xanthan gum solutions, channel flow gives rise to viscosity gradients. In our modelling, we do not explicitly account for any shear-thinning effect taking place at the microscale under the action of flagellar motion. In the following, we refer to the viscosity η = η(y) determined only by channel flow as ambient viscosity. In no-flow conditions, ambient viscosity coincides with the zero-shear viscosity ηo.",1

The cylindrical pillars have a diameter D = 50 µm. They are located at the channel half-width (y = 0), with a streamwise inter-pillar spacing of 5 mm. This distance ensures that the streamers tethered to a pillar do not perturb the fluid dynamic conditions of the pillar located downstream. The four channels on the platform are located 1.5 mm apart and have independent inlets and outlets. Such a parallelization allows the testing of multiple conditions during the same experimental run, which minimizes the biological variability.

Since the field of view at full frame was 665.6 µm wide, several images at different downstream positions on the channel midplane were acquired to image the millimeter-long streamers formed in our platform. To quantify the distribution of lengths and radii of the streamers, we acquired fluorescence images in 56 independent experimental replicates. Image analysis was performed using custom Python software. To correct for the shading artifacts resulting from the fluorescent illumination, we divided the images by a smoothed version of a calibration image acquired in a region of the platform free of any sample. The smoothing of the calibration image was performed by applying a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation σ = 32.5 µm. We then stitched the different fields of view,33 to obtain a single image of the millimeter-long streamers. To perform the morphological analysis, we binarized the stitched images using a threshold intensity value 15% higher than the background intensity value. Then, we removed noise by applying an opening operation on the images, followed by a closing operation,34 and we visually inspected the resulting images to eliminate the few artifacts generated by eDNA aggregates on the channel surface. Finally, we extracted the coordinates of the outline of the streamers and smoothed them with a Savitzky-Golay filter (15 µm window, 2nd order polynomial). Under the assumption that the streamers lie on the channel midplane (z = 0) and have variable circular cross-sections with radius R(x) and center C = C(x,yc(x),0), we extracted the length L and the radius R(x) of each streamer from the smoothed data.",1

The streamers were tested after 15 h of growth at a flow velocity U = 2.1 mm s¯¹. We performed 10 minute-long creep-recovery tests by imposing a flow profile composed of three stages: an initial stage (0 s < t <150 s), a creep stage (150 s ≤ t < 450 s), and a recovery stage (450 s < t < 600 s) (Fig. 2A). In the initial stage, we kept the unperturbed flow velocity constant (Uin = 2.1 mm s¯¹); in the creep stage, we doubled the average flow velocity (Ucr = 4.2 mm s¯¹); in the recovery stage, we lowered the velocity back to its initial value (Urec = Uin = 2.1 mm s¯¹). During each test, we acquired images of a portion of the streamer in the region between x = 400 µm and x = 1065.6 µm (Fig. 1A, ROI₂) at 1 fps in phase-contrast configuration. For each test, the deformation of a portion of the streamer was measured by tracking the relative displacement of two randomly distributed cell aggregates on the streamers (Fig. 2B, green circles). Thanks to this procedure, we identified a well-defined portion of the filament (Fig. 2B, green line) and measured its length as a function of time during the mechanical test (Fig. 2C). The aggregates were tracked using the motion tracking tools of the computer graphics software Blender.35",1

To this end, we characterized the flow field around the streamers by performing computa-tional fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, benchmarked with particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) experiments.  2.5.1 CFD simulations. We characterized the 3D hydro-dynamic conditions around the streamers for each experi-mental replicate by performing numerical simulations with COMSOL Multiphysics36 integrated with MATLAB (LiveLink for MATLAB). MATLAB scripting with LiveLink allowed us to build 3D Comsol models of each pair of streamers, based on the morphological data obtained as explained in Section 2.3. In particular, we built a 3D loft volume for each filament, developed from cross-sections of the filaments spaced by 40 µm along the length of the streamers. As guide curves for the loft operation, we built the streamer outlines at z = 0: y(x) = yc(x) +R(x) and y = yc(x) – R(x) for each filament. The lofting was performed by interpolating the cross-sections along the guide curves, resulting in smooth 3D objects that approximate the morphological data from the experiments (ESI,† Fig. S2). The hydrodynamic problem was then solved using the Laminar Flow interface of the CFD module, with the incompressible form of the Navier-Stokes and the continuity equations. We imposed the average flow velocity value U at the inlet, zero outlet pressure, and no-slip boundary conditions at the channel and pillar walls and on the surface of the streamers. We considered impermeable streamers. To reduce the computational time, we set the channel midplane as a symmetry plane and solved the system for the upper half of the channel. The results were then mirrored across the symmetry plane. The typical mesh consisted of approximately 3 × 105 elements. Subdomains were used to build a swept mesh with finer elements in the vicinity and on the surface of the streamers (see ESI†). The temperature was set to T = 23 °C, and water was set as the flowing fluid. The typical computational time was about 20 minutes (Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7820X CPU @ 3.60 GHz; RAM: 32 GB).  2.5.2 Particle tracking velocimetry. We performed PTV in selected experiments to benchmark the results of the numerical simulations. In the PTV experiments, we first flowed the bacterial suspension for 15 h; once streamers were formed, we started flowing a suspension of polystyrene tracers of diameter dtr = 1 µm (PS-Research Particles, Microparticles GmbH), at a volume fraction $ = 0.25%. The rapid switch between the two flowing suspensions was performed by using a Y connector (P-514, IDEX) located before the channel inlet. This procedure allowed us to avoid contact between the cells and the tracers during the formation of the streamers. To characterize the flow field around the entire streamers, we acquired time-lapse videos of 1300 frames on the channel midplane at different locations along the flow direction. We used bright field microscopy with the condenser diaphragm completely open (NA = 0.52) to minimize the depth of field. The frame rate of the camera was 800 fps, and the frame size was 2048 px × 256 px. Before applying the PTV algorithm to the acquisitions, we preprocessed the images to subtract the static background, calculated by averaging the intensity of the whole image stack. We segmented the particles in each frame by applying an intensity threshold equal to half the minimum intensity value calculated in each frame. Particle tracking was performed on the segmented images with a custom software based on the Trackpy Python package.37 Thanks to the small depth of field, combined with image segmentation and filters on feature size, we selected particles lying on the midplane with a spread in the z-direction of about 2dtr.",1

Before each experiment, a clonal population was inoculated in half-strength BHI broth (1/2 BHI; Biolife) and grown overnight in an orbital shaker (Innova 42; New Brunswick) at 200 rpm and 30 °C. The overnight culture was resuspended and diluted (1:100) in fresh 1/2 BHI and incubated in an orbital shaker (Innova 42; New Brunswick) at 200 rpm and 30 °C until midexponential phase (OD600nm = 0.7 to 0.8), because our preliminary experiments revealed that L. monocytogenes Scott A shows highest motility during this growth phase. Listeria cultures were washed once by centrifugation in 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes (10 min at 1,000 rpm, equivalent to 94 rcf; room temperature; Eppendorf 5425R centrifuge) and resuspended at the required concentration in nonnutrient PAS buffer (0.12 g/L NaCl, 3.94 mg/L MgSO4.7H2O, 3.02 mg/L CaCl2, 0.358 g/L Na2PO4.12H2O, and 0.136 g/L KH2PO4). Only one washing step was performed because strong or long-term centrifugation during multiple washing steps causes damage to the flagella and drastically reduces Listeria*s motility. All bacterial optical density measurements were performed at a wavelength of 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (WPA Biowave CO8000 Cell Density Meter; Biochrom). A. castellanii Neff strain (6) was used in all experiments. Acanthamoeba trophozoites were axenically cultured to exponential phase (approximately 5 × 105 cells per mL) as a monolayer in 75-cm² cell culture flasks (Bioswisstec) at room temperature in 10 mL PYG broth [20 g/L peptone (LLG Labware), 18 g/L glucose (Roth), 2 g/L yeast extract (LLG Labware), 1 g/L trisodium citrate-2H2O (Merck Group), 980 mg/L MgSO4.7H2O, 52 mg/L Na2PO4.12H2O, 340 mg/L KH2PO4, and 20 mg/L Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O]. Further preparations with amoebae are specified for each individual experiment below. A. castellanii concentrations were determined using a Brand counter chamber (Brandblau Neubauer pattern, 0.100 mm depth; Merck). Attached A. castellanii cells were gently scraped from the bottom of the flask with one-directional movement using a cell scraper (Bioswisstec).

The LGG chip was then preloaded with the respective samples (see below). This was achieved by connecting each of the inlets of the chip to a syringe (10 mL, BD Luer-Lok Sterile syringes with 23-gauge 1/2 5FVJ3 syringe tips) with tubing (Cole-Parmer Tygon Tubing PG-06419-01) (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). The three syringes were mounted on a syringe pump (PHD2000; Harvard Apparatus); one syringe was loaded with the respective sample and connected to one side channel, and the other two syringes were loaded with PAS buffer and connected to the other side channel and to the central channel (Fig. 2A). Outlets were connected via tubing (as above) to an empty 50-mL Falcon tube to collect waste liquid. Unless specified otherwise, flow rate of 15 µL/min was applied for the experiment.

Peaudecerf, David Drissner, Martin J. Loessner, Roman Stocker, Markus Schuppler",PNAS,Image processing and analysis,"Image processing and analysis were performed using ImageJ (NIH) and in-house Python scripts (SI Appendix, Python Scripts). Raw 16-bit video files (.ND2) were converted to 16-bit tiff-files using ImageJ. Videos were cropped so that the resulting frames (~1,000 × 1,000 µm) contained the full width of the central channel but no regions of the hydrogel walls. To reduce background noise, the median value for each pixel over all frames was subtracted from that pixel for each frame. This resulted in a pixel-value distribution centered around zero. A custom 8-bit conversion was then performed by adding 125 to all pixel values and setting the resulting pixel values that were smaller than 0 to 0 and those that were greater than 255 to 255. This resulted in videos with reduced file size while maintaining a broad dynamic range of pixel values. A 2- × 2-pixel Gaussian blur was performed (to reduce pixel noise) prior to thresholding all pixel values above 118 to 255 to remove nonbacterial features. In the resulting videos, bacteria appear as dark objects on a white background.  Bacterial cells were segmented and tracked from frame to frame using TrackPy (53). Nonmotile cells were then excluded as motility is crucial to perform chemotaxis. To achieve this, mean squared displacements were calculated with a maximum delay time of 1 s (or 25 frames, which is the minimum timeframe for a trajectory to be considered for analysis). The slope of the mean squared displacement, known as the translational component, can be used to categorize bacteria on the basis of their movement into adherers (cells that stick to the surface), diffusers (cells that are nonmotile and randomly diffuse), and superdiffusers (cells that are motile and randomly diffuse) (54). Here, we set the threshold for the translational component to 1.2, above which all bacterial trajectories were considered to fall within the superdiffuser or motile regime. In order to obtain a single point position for each bacterial trajectory, the average position of each trajectory was calculated. These positions were then used to calculate the",1

Peaudecerf, David Drissner, Martin J. Loessner, Roman Stocker, Markus Schuppler",PNAS,Capture Rate Experiments,"To quantify capture rates, we observed the inter- actions between L. monocytogenes Scott A and A. castellanii within a microfluidic channel (Fig. 3A). A. castellanii trophozoites (see Culture Conditions) were washed, 10 times in total, with PAS buffer. Attached cells were scraped from the bottom of the culture flask and diluted in PAS buffer to a final concentration of ~5 × 10^ cells per mL. A volume of 200 µL A. castellanii suspension was trans- ferred into a single-channel microfluidic chip (µ-Slide 1 0.6 Luer ibiTreat chip; Ibidi), where they were left for 20 to 30 min to allow cells to attach to the sur- face. The buffer was then gently replaced with a washed and diluted L. monocy- togenes suspension (200 µL), at one of three bacterial concentrations: 2 × 107, 1 x 107, or 0.5 × 107 CFU/mL (based on OD600 measurements). The microflui- dic chip was then immediately transferred to an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti2) for image acquisition using a 20× objective (numerical aperture = 0.45). А region of interest encompassing at least five A. castellanii cells was selected and the focal plane was set to 5 µm above the bottom surface of the microfluidic channel. For a period of 1 h, 2-min time-lapse videos were recorded at 20 fps, with 1-min intervals between videos, resulting in 20 time points for each experi- ment. Triplicate experiments were performed for each bacterial concentration. Image processing and analysis were performed using ImageJ (NIH) and in-house Python scripts (SI Appendix, Python Scripts). Raw video files were con- verted from 16-bit ND2-files to 16-bit TIFF-files using ImageJ (NIH). Around each unobstructed A. castellanii trophozoite (i.e., located more than 20 µm from the edge of the field of view and from any other A. castellanii trophozoite), a region of interest (350 × 350 pixels or 113.75 × 113.75 µm) was cropped and saved as a separate video. Using Python, pixel values within each video were rescaled and converted to 8 bit to reduce file size, without compromising dynamic pixel value range. This was achieved by dividing the 16-bit pixel values by 2.5, then centering all pixel values around 125 by subtracting the global median value of all pixels over all frames from all pixels in each frame and adding 125. Pixel val- ues above 255 and below 0 were set to 255 and 0, respectively. Prior to tracking of the Listeria cells with Trackpy (53), two dynamic masks (an Acanthamoeba mask and an interaction mask for each individual frame) were created for each region of interest using mathematical operations from the OpenCV (55) and SciPy (56) modules (Fig. 3A and Movie S1). The Acanthamoeba mask covered the area of the A. castellanii cell and was used to remove particles detected in this area over all frames of the recording prior to trajectory building. Without this mask, trajectory building of free-swimming L. monocytogenes was severely impaired. The interaction mask was a larger version of the Acantha- moeba mask, extending 4 µm (approximately twice the length of a Listeria cell) beyond the Acanthamoeba mask, all around its boundary (Fig. 3B). The interac- tion mask allowed us to count the captured Listeria for each time point by taking the difference between the numbers of bacterial cells that entered and left this mask. For each experiment, digital controls were performed by selecting a region of interest where no A. castellanii cells were present. Within this region, we counted *captured* L. monocytogenes cells using a randomly chosen and ran- domly positioned interaction mask from the same experiment. Since there was no A. castellanii present in these control regions, the expected number of captured L. monocytogenes cells is zero (as bacteria have an equal chance of entering and exiting this control mask), thereby providing a way to validate the imaging analysis method used to quantify the capture rate. Because we imaged for 2 out of every 3 minutes, we estimated the number of captured L. monocytogenes between two time points by increasing the observed num- ber of captured L. monocytogenes by a factor of 1.5. Using the same approach as described for the chemotaxis assays, nonmotile L. monocytogenes were identified by the translational component of their mean squared displacement, with values",1

Loessner, Roman Stocker, Markus Schuppler",PNAS,Comparison of Experimentally Derived Capture Rates and Theoretical Encounter Rates,"To investigate the mechanisms driving the capture dynam- ics of L. monocytogenes by A. castellanii, we quantified capture rates from the cumulative capture curves derived from our video analyses and compared them to theoretical encounter rates expected from random bacterial swimming motil- ity, which we estimated for each A. castellanii trophozoite based on parameters estimated individually. Based on the shape of the experimental cumulative capture curves and after testing several regression methods, we selected a satu- rating exponential function of time for the cumulative captured number of L. monocytogenes cells per A. castellanii cell based on fit performance. Regres- sions were performed in Graphpad Prism version 9.0.1 for Windows (GraphPad Software). For each amoeba, the cumulative capture curve was fitted (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) with a saturating exponential function of time t, C = a(1-e), [1] from which the maximum number of captured Listeria cells for that amoeba, a, and the saturation time, ß, were obtained. a is equal to the y-value of the horizontal asymptote that forms the upper limit of the saturating func- tion, and ß represents the typical time at which the function starts signifi- cantly saturating. The capture rate y (cells per minute) per amoeba was then computed as = α [2] which is equal to the slope of the initial, near linear phase of the cumulative cap- ture curve. In order to determine the number of L. monocytogenes cells that each A. cas- tellanii cell would be expected to encounter, we selected two known analytical expressions for a flux of randomly diffusing particles that encounter a perfectly absorbing geometry (28), in which A. castellanii trophozoites are modeled as a disk or as a half-sphere attached to a surface, with bacterial encounters happen- ing only on the surface of the trophozoite not in contact with substrate. We con- sidered these two equations because the shape of the A. castellanii trophozoite lies between these two geometries. For the disk scenario Kdisk, bacteria were encountered at a rate (cells per unit time) Kdisk = 4DrabL [3] where D is the diffusivity, b₁ is the concentration of motile Listeria cells, and ra is the radius of the A. castellanii trophozoite. In Eq. 3, all encountered cells are con- sidered to be captured. The diffusivity of motile L. monocytogenes was quantified from the classical approximation (28) as D= να τ 3* [4] where v is the average swimming speed obtained from tracking motile Listeria cells and t is the average duration of a run between reorientations. This run duration is here taken to be 1 s, as is typical for Listeria (36) and other species such as E. coli (28) and Bacillus subtilis (35). The linear dependency of encounter rates with this parameter makes our conclusions robust to variation in its precise value (see Discussion). For the scenario with a half-sphere geometry Khs, bacteria were encountered at a rate (cells per unit time) Khs = 2πDrabL. [5] Also here, the model considers all encountered cells to be captured. To compute the theoretical encounter rates based on the experimentally observed organism characteristics, we focused on the initial phase of the cumula- tive capture curves (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), corresponding to the capture rates prior to saturation y, Eq. 2. Specifically, in quantifying Kdisk and Khs (Eqs. 3",1

A. castellanii tropho- zoites (see Culture Conditions) were scraped from the bottom of the culture flask and diluted with PYG broth to a final concentration of ~5 × 104 cells per mL. A volume of 200 µL of A. castellanii suspension was added into a well and the cells were allowed to settle on the bottom surface for 20 to 30 min before the well was gently washed three times with 200 µL PAS buffer. L. monocytogenes cells were then added, consisting of a 1:4 ratio of prewashed L. monocytogenes Scott A::pPL2Phypgfp and Scott A wild-type cells in PAS buffer, at a total concen- tration of 2 × 10′ CFU/mL. Thus, only 20% of the L. monocytogenes population was fluorescently labeled to ensure that tracking of individual cells was possible. The µ-Slide was immediately transferred to a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS-SPE; Leica Microsystems). An A. castellanii trophozoite was rapidly and ran- domly selected from the field of view, and a time-lapse video (0.75 fps) was recorded using a 100× objective (Leica HCX PL FLUOTAR Oil 100×) with an exci- tation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength range of 500 to 565 nm. The focal plane varied slightly between and during observations to ensure trapped L. monocytogenes cells stayed in focus. The time-lapse recording lasted until a clear backpack of bacterial cells was observed on the surface of the A. castellanii, which typically took between 4 and 7 min. A total of eight A. castel- lanii trophozoites from three biological replicate cultures were recorded in eight separate experiments. Movement of the A. castellanii trophozoite and relocation of captured GFP-expressing L. monocytogenes cells were tracked manually using ImageJ (SI Appendix, Manual Tracking of Individual GFP-Expressing L. monocytogenes Trapped on the Outer Surface of A. castellanii). Upon cap- ture by A. castellanii, each GFP-expressing L. monocytogenes cell was marked with a colored circle and tracked until the bacterium was added into the back- pack. To represent the instantaneous location of the A. castellanii, a white cross was placed at the mass center of the cell, calculated by ImageJ. The tra- jectory of the A. castellanii trophozoite was obtained by connecting these mass centers in consecutive images.",1

This fluid flow solver is a highly parallelized pseudospectral code that allows for the integration of particle species advected with the fluid flow (50). The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations take the form ди  Ət + u · ∇u = −∇p + v∇²u + f, Vu = 0. [6a] [6b] Here, u is the three-dimensional velocity field, p denotes the kinematic pressure, and v is the kinematic viscosity in code units. f is a large-scale forcing that drives the flow to ensure a statistically stationary state. We rescale the simulation units and parameters to physically and biologically relevant ones. In our simulations, we keep the large-scale forcing constant and adjust viscosity (and simulation resolution) to achieve ε in the range 10-9 to 10-6 W/kg, which corresponds to oceanic values up to moderate turbulence levels (44). To convert from code units to physical units, let us denote l and τ as the conversion factors from code units to physical units for space and time, respectively. Additionally, consider the integral length scale of the flow based on the longitudinal velocity autocorrelation function as Lint and the code integral length Lint. Following this convention, symbols with a tilde refer to code units whereas symbols without a tilde refer to physical units. Consistent with experiments in turbulence tanks, we set the integral length scale to Lint = 10 cm-since the simulation domain is a cube with size ≈6Lint, our simulations represent a turbulence tank of about 200 to 300 L (51). From this we can fix l as Lint = Lintl ⇒ l = Lint/Lint Additionally, we have to match water viscosity to physical units, which fixes τ: v=ῦℓτ¯¹ ⇒T = (Lint/Lint)² Using these conversion factors we can calculate the dissipation rate in physical units for a given dissipation rate in code units: ε= ẽ l² τ−3 Finally, we set the rod length to a fixed length in physical units, i.e., millimeters, and rescale it correspondingly into code units. In Fig. 2A, we explored three rod lengths in the neutrally buoyant case, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 mm. In Fig. 2B, we studied also neutrally buoyant rods and varied both aspect ratio and rod length, covering the cases λ = 100 and / = 1.0 mm, as well as λ = 20 and / = 80 µm. Finally, in Fig. 2 C and D we kept the aspect ratio λ = 100 and length / = 1.0 mm fixed and scanned the density offset variable Δp and the turbulence intensity ε. In Fig. 2C, we concentrated on the biologically relevant Δp regime, while the collapse in Fig. 2D is based on a larger dataset that includes heavier rods to resolve the sinking-dominated regime-this larger dataset is shown in Sl Appendix, Fig. S1. Other relevant values used for the simulations are reported in SI Appendix, Table S1.",1

To model sinking cells, we describe the positional and orientational dynamics of small thin elongated ellipsoidal particles sinking in a turbulent flow with no back reaction onto the flow, and we neglect inertial effects owing to the fast relaxation timescales of planktonic cells (15, 52). Specifically, the translational relaxation timescale τρ for elongated particles is tp = pl² In(λ + √λ² − 1)/(18μλ√λ² – 1) (52), where p is the cell density, I and λ are the cell*s length and aspect ratio, and μ is the fluid*s dynamic viscosity.

Lalescu, Roman Stocker, Michael Wilczek",PNAS,Encounter Detection Algorithm,"Particle encounters are measured using the so-called ghost encounters (59); i.e., particles may overlap but do not interact during collisions. For the encounter detection algorithm, we approximate the particles as thin rods with spherical caps (Fig. 1D). Encounters between thin rods can be calculated by searching for the minimal distance between the two symmetry axes of the rods. Consider a first rod at a position x with orientation p and a second rod with orientation ĝ at a position y. Both rods have length / and width w. Positions along the rods may be parameterized by use of the parameters t, s ∈ [-1, 1], such that any point along the symmetry axis of the rods may be written as r₁(t) = x + t (1-1)2 p; t∈ [-1,1] for the first rod and r2(s) = y + s (1-1)29 S∈ [-1,1] for the second rod. The distance between two points on the symmetry axis of the rods is then dist(t, s) = √( [r₁(t) -r2(s)]2 ) where x = x - y. The minimum distance can be found by setting the gradient of this distance function to zero. This leads to a linear system, which can be solved leading to tmin = λ (1 λ−1 ) (p.q)( ∆x.q) − ∆x.p ( λ2 −1) ∆x.q2 ∆x.p , Smin = 2 λ tmin p.q + λ−1 ∆x.q λ −1 [17] This yields the minimum distance if | tmin | ≤ 1 and | Smin | ≤ 1. If |tmin | ≥ 1 or |Smin | ≥ 1, we must search for the minimum distance along |t| = 1 and |s| = 1. In these latter cases, the minimum distance can be analytically found. For tmin = ±1 Smin = 2 λ tmin p.q + λ−1 ∆x.q λ −1 [18] For Smin = ±1 tmin = Smin p.q + 2 λ ∆x.p λ −1 ∆x.q. [19] Particle overlaps at a given time snapshot can then be detected by dist(tmin, Smin) < w. This means, at their minimum distance, the rods are less than one width apart from one another. We then keep track of overlaps of particle pairs. At every time step we compare the overlap of particle pairs with the ones from the previous time step. If the overlap of a particle pair is detected that was not detected in the previous time step, we count that overlap change as a new encounter. This new encounter contributes to the total number of new encounters Nenc. Given a number of new encounters Nenc in a given time T, volume V, and total number of particles Npart, the encounter kernel is then obtained as (59) Γ = 2 V Nenc / Npart^2 [20] In our simulations, the simulation domain is a cube with side length 2π and volume V = 8π³ in code units. We typically run the simulations for time T on the order of several integral timescales (defined as Lint/Urms). For our choice of particle numbers Npart (SI Appendix, Table S1), these simulation times guarantee statistical convergence of the kernel estimate in Eq. 20. We also remove an initial transient time of two integral timescales, which allows for the spatial and orientational distributions of particles to reach a statistically stationary state. Thus, with the number of detected encounters (Nenc is on the order of 1,000 encounters per integral timescale), Eq. 20 gives us an encounter kernel in code units, with units of space³/time. Finally, using the transformation factors in Eqs. 7 and 8 this quantity may then be transformed into physical units.",1

Parks, Gene W. Tyson, Philip Hugenholtz, Roman Stocker, Justin R. Seymour, Lasse Riemann",ISME,Laboratory chemotaxis experiments with bacterial isolates,"The HBDs, Pseudomonas stutzeri BAL361, Raoultella ornitinolytica BAL286 (Gammaproteobacteria), and Rhodopseudomonas palustris BAL398 (Alphaproteobacteria), isolated from the Baltic Sea [45, 46], were grown at room temperature in ZoBell broth adjusted to salinity 8 [47] and screened for motility by observing cells using an Eclipse Ci microscope equipped with phase contrast (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Two HBD isolates, P. stutzeri and R. palustris, exhibited motility and were subsequently prepared for laboratory chemotaxis experiments as follows. Overnight cultures of P. stutzeri and R. palustris (OD600 = 0.6 (1 day) and OD600 = 0.3 (2 day), respectively) were diluted 1:1000 in 1% ZoBell broth (in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS); autoclaved; salinity 8; pH 7.4; Medicago, Uppsala, Sweden), incubated for an additional 2 h, before being diluted 10-fold in PBS to obtain a cell suspension of ~1-2 × 10° cells ml-1. To investigate the chemotactic capabilities of HBD isolates in laboratory experiments, as well as natural assemblages of HBDs in the marine environment, we used the in situ chemotaxis assay (ISCA; [43, 44]). This microfluidic device is composed of an array of wells linked to the outside environment by a port (Fig. S1A). Putative chemoattractants are loaded into the wells and, following ISCA deployment, diffuse out of the wells creating concentration gradients that are analogous to naturally occurring chemical hotspots. Motile and chemotactic cells can use these concentration gradients to migrate into the wells where they can then be sampled. All experiments were conducted with four ISCAs deployed in parallel (n = 4), with each ISCA allowing five technical replicates of five different treatments to be deployed simultaneously (Fig. S1B). Chemotaxis experiments were performed with organic and inorganic N sources (glutamine, glutamate, cysteine, and NH4+; all at 1 mM) and phytoplankton-derived DOM (see below). Amino acids and phytoplankton-derived organic materials were chosen as chemoattractants because amino acids are released via ectoenzymatic hydrolysis of particles [39] and dead phytoplankton are an important constituent of marine particles [48–51], suggesting that gradients of these chemicals will emanate from particles [40]. Both isolates were tested with nitrogen sources, whereas only P. stutzeri was tested with phytoplankton-derived DOM (see below for additional information). Phytoplankton-derived DOM was obtained from algal cells and exudates. For laboratory experiments, phytoplankton cultures of 200 ml (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP 1335) were grown to stationary phase at their optimal light, temperature, and nutrient conditions. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (1500 × g for 10 min) and the pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for chemical extraction. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and subjected to a solid-phase extraction (SPE) using Oasis HLB SPE columns (Waters Corp, Milford, MA, USA) following a protocol adapted from Dittmar et al. [52]. Briefly, supernatant was acidified to pH 2 using 10% HCl, and exuded metabolites were adsorbed onto the SPE cartridges using gravity flow. SPE cartridges were then dried for 20 min before being eluted with 75% HPLC-grade methanol, which was aliquoted and dried before use in chemotaxis assays. Phytoplankton-derived DOM was prepared by extract-ing organic matter from the pellet according to Raina et al. [42]. Briefly, cells were extracted with 75% HPLC-grade methanol, sonicated on ice to break the cell walls, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. Extracts were aliquoted, dried and normalized to 1 mg ml-1 before use in chemotaxis assays. Total organic carbon (TOC) in the phytoplankton extracts and exudates of C. reinhardtii and T. pseudonana used in the laboratory chemotaxis assays was measured on a TOC-L TOC analyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Ultrafiltered PBS was used as control for the chemotaxis assay as well as to resuspend the different treatments and was prepared by sequential filtration through a 0.2 µm Millex FG filter (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), twice through a 0.2 µm Sterivex filter (Millipore), and through a 0.02 µm Anotop filter (Whatman, Kent, UK). For laboratory-based chemotaxis experiments, ISCAs were secured inside sterile plastic trays and 1 h incubations at room temperature were initiated by the addition of 80 ml cell suspension [44]. Following incubations (see below), the contents of the ISCA wells were collected using a 1 ml syringe and a 27G needle (Terumo, Sydney, Australia). For each ISCA, the contents of five wells were pooled to gain ~550 µl, which was fixed with 0.2 µm-filtered glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration) for subsequent flow cytometry analysis (performed on the same day). Samples for flow cytometry were stained with SYBR Green (1:10,000 final dilution; Thermo Fisher), incubated for 15 min in the dark and analyzed on a CytoFLEX (model LX and S) flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with filtered MilliQ water as sheath fluid. For each sample, forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC), and green (SYBR) fluorescence were recorded and the samples were analyzed at a flow rate of 25 µl min¯¹. Microbial populations were characterized according to SSC and SYBR Green fluorescence [53]. Το quantify the strength of chemotaxis, the chemotactic index Ic was calculated by dividing the number of cells present in a given treatment by the average number of cells present in the control [43]. Thus, Ic values >1 indicate an attraction, while Ic values <1 suggest a repulsion.",1

[42]. Seawater freshly collected from the field site was ultrafiltered (as above) and used as a control and to resuspend the dried phytoplankton-derived organic matter (concentration: 1 mg ml¯¹). Flow cytometry (as above) confirmed that the filtration protocol removed all bacterial cells from seawater. Prior to the field deployment, phytoplankton cultures were grown to mid-exponential phase at their optimal light, temperature and nutrient conditions [42]. The supernatant was discarded, phytoplankton-derived DOM was extracted from the pellet (as above), and used as chemoat-tractant. Each phytoplankton-derived DOM treatment was resuspended in ultrafiltered seawater from the site at a concentration of 1 mg ml-¹ and replicated across four ISCAs deployed simultaneously. Each ISCA was secured inside a sealed enclosure [43] and deployed at 1 m depth for 1 h. Upon retrieval, the contents of the ISCA wells were collected as described above with the following modification: from the pooled sample, 80 µl was fixed with 0.2 µm-filtered glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration) for flow cytometry analysis (conducted the same day) and 470 µl was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent DNA extraction. Bulk seawater samples (500 µl, n = 4) from the site (1 m depth) were also collected for flow cytometry and DNA sequencing. DNA extraction from ISCA samples was performed under a UV clean hood (UVC/T-M-AR, Biosan, Riga, Latvia) using a microvolume physical lysis extraction [54].

Fernandez, and Roman Stocker2,**",Biophysical Journal,Experimental setup,"We performed the chemotaxis assays using a microfluidic device made by sandwiching an agarose gel layer between a glass microscope slide and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer patterned with three parallel channels. We created the channels by molding the PDMS onto a silicon wafer with positive-relief features. We fabricated the device with the following specifications (46): the channels were 20-mm long, 100-µm deep, and 600-µm wide, with 400-µm spacing between each channel, and the agarose layer was 0.5-mm thick and consisted of a 3% (w/v) solution of agarose in motility medium. Each of the three channels contained an inlet and outlet port. The outer two channels functioned as feeder channels within which a steady flow of media, at a rate of 10 µL per minute, was maintained using a syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA). We set the syringe pump to *refill* mode to create a negative pressure that, along with loosely fitting clips, helped create a seal between the PDMS and agarose. We flowed motility medium with maltose (D-maltose monohydrate; PHR1497, Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA) at concentrations of 0-20 µM in the left channel and motility medium with MeAsp (Sigma-Aldrich M6001) at concentrations of 0-460 µM in the right channel. As mol- ecules diffuse freely through agarose, the flow of these solutions in the outer channels created constant gradients within the agarose and hence within the central test channel. The ability of this microfluidic system to maintain linear concentration profiles was verified previously using fluorescein (45). For example, with 2 μΜ of maltose in the left channel and motility medium in the right channel, the cells in the test channel experienced a linear gradient with a slope of approximately 1.4 × 10-3 µM/µm and min- imum and maximum concentrations of 0.57 μΜ and 1.43 μΜ. Initially, the central channel was empty of liquid so that, after establish- ing flow in the outer feeder channels, a steady gradient formed within the lower agarose layer over a timescale of L²/D, where L is the distance be- tween the two feeder channels and D is the diffusivity of the molecules through agarose. The agarose gel layer has a diffusivity very similar to wa- ter so that, for small molecules, D ≈ 103 µm²/s. Therefore, with a 1400 μm spacing between the edges of the two outer channels, gradients formed across the agarose layer in about 30 min. Forty-five min after the establishment of flow in the outer channels, we pipetted the refrigerated cells into the test channel and sealed the test chan- nel using glass microscope coverslips.

For the transport-and-sensing model, we constrained the parameter ranges based on estimates from previous litera- ture, whereas for the indirect-binding model, we conducted our search over various series of large sweeps. When fitting the indirect-binding model to our single-gradient maltose chemotaxis assays, we found no choice of parameter values that could capture both the narrow range of maltose sensing and the strong peak response at 4 µM of maltose (Fig. S2; Materials and methods). On the other hand, we were able to find a good fit to our chemotaxis assays using our transport-and-sensing model (Fig. 3; Materials and methods). We found that our trans- port-and-sensing model captures not only the steady-state cell distributions in the maltose single-gradient chemotaxis assays but also the steady-state cell distributions in the MeAsp experiments and in the opposing-gradient experi- ments, both of which we conducted to help us constrain our maltose parameter fits. This supports the validity of our model*s assumption that transport is porin limited in the chemotactic regime. Because our model is underdetermined, we obtained our fit by constraining the receptor cooperativity to nTar = 4, matching the finding that nTar = 6 for E. coli strain LJ110 under similar culture conditions and that the Tar to serine re- ceptor ratio is 1.5 times higher in strain LJ110 than in the strain we used, RP437 (19). In addition, to make the param- eter sweep tractable, we used literature values for [R]total = 20 μΜ (50) and [BP]total = 1 mM (23). With the three pa- rameters thus constrained, our obtained fit is KI, MeAsp = 26 μΜ, ΚΑ, MeAsp = 260 μΜ, ΚΙ, Mal = 12 µM, KA, Mal = 18 µM, and V/Vp = 7.5 × 10^4 (Fig. 3). This fit supports our constraint that nTar = 4, as the dissociation constants of MeAsp to Tar closely match previous estimates of KI, MeAsp = 30 µM and KA, MeAsp = 500 μΜ (19) as well as our own fit from the FRET data of KI, MeAsp = 27.5 µM and KA, MeAsp = 365 μΜ (Fig. S10). Additionally, our estimates for the maltose-receptor binding constants (KI,Mal = 12 µM and KA,Mal = 18 µM) reasonably match ob- servations that these dissociation constants are in the micro- molar range (49). Finally, our fit*s estimate that V/Vp = 7.5 × 10^4 is in line with a rough estimate that we obtained previously by fitting our maltose transport model to past ex- periments with V/Vp ≈ 1 × 10^4 (34). The consistency of all fitted parameter values with previous observations sup- ports the validity of our transport-and-sensing model. For the obtained fit and taking [L]ext = 1 µM, our model predicts that [L:BP] = 14.9 µM and [L]p = 30.1 nM (Fig. 4 A and B). This predicted nanomolar concentration of free maltose in the periplasm supports our understanding that maltose trans- port into the cell is severely porin limited in the chemotactic regime. Because the transport-and-sensing model has one more free parameter than the indirect-binding model, it may not",1

We cultured, washed, and har- vested the cells according to the protocol described above and then placed the cells in 3 mL of motility medium with various concentrations of maltose. Because the cells experienced the maltose gradients for at most 30 min in our chemotaxis assays, after 30 min, we froze the samples at -80°C until we per- formed immunoblotting. To lyse the cells, we added 200 µL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCL, 0.1% Triton X-100, 250 U/mL benzonase nuclease, and 0.4 mg/mL lyzosyme) into each 3-mL frozen sample, vortexed them, and shook the tubes for 30 min at 37°C. We then added loading Laemmli buffer (1:4) and incubated them at 95°C for 5 min. We loaded 10 µL of each sample into a pre-prepared 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) and separated the protein by electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h in a Bio-Rad Tetra cell apparatus. We blotted the gel against a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol) at 100 V for 1 h.

We begin by considering the DOM concentration around a single Synechococcus cell in an unbounded, quiescent fluid. The exuded molecules diffuse radially and are consumed by bacteria distributed throughout the domain. Owing to the spherical symmetry of the problem, both the DOM concentration, C(r, t), and the bacterial concentration, B(r, t), may be written as functions of distance, r, from the Synechococcus cell, and time, t.

The relative performance (DOM exposure) of WT bacteria compared with their non-chemotactic or non-motile counterparts is examined. To begin with, we outline the agent-based model for bacterial chemotaxis. This model incorporates the essential features of bacterial navigation, and accurately captures the chemotaxis of another marine bacterium, Vibrio ordalii³² responding to dissolved glutamate sources (less than 1% fitting error). Where possible, we have updated specific model parameters for the case of M. adhaerens (for all model parameters, see Supplementary Table 8). In the laboratory frame, the DOM concentration is given by the smooth function C(x). In each simulation timestep, At = 0.10 s, a bacterium with velocity v and position x performs a noisy measurement of the concentration change in its reference frame, C₁/dt = N (µ, σ²). This stochastic measurement is normally distributed with mean µ = v • VC and standard deviation σ = I [3C (x, t) /παDT3]1/2, and therefore directly incorporates the fundamental precision with which a cell can measure the gradient. Here is the chemotactic precision factor and T is the timescale over which the bacteria measure the gradient (see ref. 32). For each bacterium, we model an internal state variable, S(t), which evolves according to ds / dt = -S / tm + κΝ (μ, σ²), where t₁ = 1.3 s is the adaptation timescales and k is the effective receptor gain-the receptor gain rescaled by the half-saturation constant (see ref. 32).

AE92.2, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) under shaking at 120 r.p.m. at 30°C and were collected after 12-18h of incubation. A. chroococcum was cultured in 15 ml of sterile Burk*s media [46] under shaking at 120 r.p.m. at 30 °C and was collected after 24 h of incubation. The strains of M. xanthus were cultured in 15 ml of liquid Casitone-Tris complex medium (CTT) [47] under shaking at 120 r.p.m. at 30 °C and were collected after 12–18h of incubation. A. cylindrica was cultured in 20 ml of sterile nitrogen-free BG11 [48] in a 16h light and 8 h darkness cycle, with shaking at 70 r.p.m. at RT, and the cells were collected after 36h of incubation (Table 1). Spore induction and collection The spores of B. subtilis, B. sphaericus, B. thuringiensis, S. violaceoruber and S. avermitilis were produced by inoculating Petri dishes of nutrient agar (NA) (art. no. AE92.2, Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and then incubating them at 30°C for 2-3 days for endospores and 3-5 days for exospores. The endospores of B. subtilis, B. sphaericus and B. thuringiensis were collected with the loop from the surface of the agar and resuspended in 2 ml of sterile 0.2 M glycerol solution. The exospores of S. violaceoruber and S. avermitilis were collected by adding 100 sterile glass beads (4mm diameter) into the surface of the culture with shaking for 30 s. To recover the exospores that adhered to the beads, 5 ml of TX buffer [0.05 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 0.001% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, pH 7.3] was then added and the fluid was collected into a 15 ml Falcon tube. This process was repeated twice to maximize the collection of all spores. The buffer containing the spores was then centrifuged at 10000 g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was removed, and the spores were resuspended in 2 ml of sterile 0.2 M glycerol solution. The cysts of A. chroococcum were produced as follows. Approximately 20 ml of vegetative cells were produced as indicated above in Burk*s media. After 12h the media were centrifuged at 3000 g and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then resuspended in approximately 20 ml of Burk*s sucrose-free liquid media with 0.2% of n-butanol and was incubated at room temperature for 5-7 days. The myxospores from M. xanthus strains were produced by inoculating densely on Petri dishes with ¼ CTT (CTT media with ½ of the original Casitone) solid medium with incubation at 30°C for 5–7 days. ¼ CTT media was used instead of TPM media to obtain a larger number of spores. The myxospores were then collected with a loop from the agar surface and resuspended in 2 ml of sterile physiological water (0.9% NaCl). Akinetes of A. cylindrica were produced by placing approximately 20 ml of a stationary culture of A. cylindrica covered with aluminium at 4°C for 10–14 days (Table 1).",1

The samples were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 30% dextran (D1662 from Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MI, USA). They were then cooled under high pressure (2000 bar) to liquid nitrogen temperature (–196 °C) within milliseconds using an EM-PACT2 machine (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). These conditions prevent the formation of ice crystals, which can damage cellular structures [50]. The frozen samples were then cut into thin slices (50 nm) in a cryo-ultramicrotome UC6 FC6 (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and placed on a R3.5–1 holey carbon EM grid (Quantifoil, Großlöbichau, Germany). Samples prepared in this way were then loaded into a Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) on a cryo-holder model 626 (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA) keeping the sample temperature low (−180°C) and analysed by the low-dose method at 200 kV acceleration voltage. Image analysis The CEMOVIS images were analysed using Fiji version 2.3.0/1.53f [51]. For each species, representative high-quality images were selected to analyse the cell envelope density profile of both vegetative and spore cells. Using the line tool, a perpendicular line with a 23 pixel width was drawn across the cell envelope to reduce noise. From this line, the density profile was plotted for each image. The width of the cell wall was measured five times in different areas of the cell for five different images to obtain an average width. In the case of the Akinetes, only one image was of sufficient quality to assess the width of the cell envelope.",1

A 2 µl drop containing a sample of either vegetative cells or spores for each strain was placed on an aluminium-coated slide (A1136; EMF Corporation, Rochester, NY, USA) and dried at 30 °C for 15 min. The sample was briefly rinsed in 0.2 M glycerol solution to remove the residual traces of the medium. The sample was then dried under a constant air flow and the Raman spectra of single cells were measured. A 10mW laser was focused on a single cell and a spectral window of 800–3300 cm¯¹ (3.5 cm¯¹ resolution) was measured with a 10s exposure time. For A. cylindrica PCC7122 that generates strong Raman signals (resonance Raman scattering due to the presence of carotenoids [52]), a 0.3mW laser power and a 1 s exposure time were used. This additional manipulation is not expected to modify the chemical signatures obtained. For each sample 15-20 individual cells were measured, and a representative Raman spectrum was normalized with respect to the maximum and minimum intensities (I-I)/(I-I) are shown. No further data processing (smoothing or baseline subtraction) was conducted.\nValidation of an endospore-specific marker Nine endospore-forming bacteria were used to establish an endospore-specific chemical marker. These were compared with other spore-formers and asporogenic bacteria. The endospore-forming bacteria used were B. subtilis (NEU16, Neuchâtel University culture collection), B. thuringiensis (NEU1070/DSM350), B. sphaericus (NEU1003, Neuchâtel University culture collection), Paenibacillus marcerans (NEU1004), Paenibacillus alvei (NEU1291, Neuchâtel University culture collection), Bacillus cereus (SPO95, Neuchâtel University culture collection), Bacillus weihenstephanensis (SPO146, Neuchâtel University culture collection), Bacillus cereus (SPO91, Neuchâtel University culture collection) and Bacillus sp.

The method used for the sample preparation for the vegetative cells and spores is described above.\nSingle-cell Raman microspectroscopy in liquid In order to implement a sorting step in a microfluidics device, the cells must be analysed in liquid. Therefore, the measurements were made in liquid to make the analysis pipeline compatible with a fluid-based sorting capability. The same confocal Raman microspectroscope (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba Scientific, France), laser, confocal pinhole and detector as indicated above were used. In this case, the system was based on an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-E). A 300 lines mm¯¹ diffraction grating (blazed at 600 nm) and a 63× water-immersion objective (Nikon SR Plan Apo IR 60XC WI, NA=1.27) were installed. Additionally, optical tweezers formed using a 1064 nm laser were used to immobilize cells during the Raman measurement. For these measurements, a sample of either vegetative cells or spores was resuspended in 0.2 M glycerol solution and a 5 ul drop of the sample was put in a microchamber. The sample was sandwiched between two glass coverslips (150 µm thickness) and two coverslips were placed between these coverslips as a spacer, providing the fluid microchamber with a thickness of 150 µm. Single cells were captured using optical tweezers (formed using a 1064 nm laser) and their Raman spectra were measured. A spectral window of 400–3300 cm¯¹ was measured with a 100mW laser power and a 1s exposure time. For A. cylindrica PCC7122, a 3 mW laser power and a 1 s exposure time were used.

Therefore, in the following, the image intensity will be referred to as relative intensity, Is. Images were binarized with a threshold of Is = 0.6 to identify the outline of the biofilm, where the value of 0.6 was determined by visual inspection of the performance in determining the outline. From the binarized images, individual bodies were extracted. Bodies smaller than 100 pixels (corresponds to 1062 µm²) were removed to reduce noise and facilitate cluster analysis. Cluster analysis was then performed to determine the number of clusters in the porous medium (N), the mean cluster area (A), and the fractal dimension of the system (D₁). Cluster analysis was performed in Fiji ImageJ (with the plugins Particle Size Distribution and Fractal Box Counter). Characterization of the cluster size distribution included only clusters before percolation was reached (i.e., before the time at which a single biofilm cluster formed that spanned the entire length of the porous medium from inlet to outlet). The size of each cluster was quantified as the radius of gyration of the cluster, R = √A/π, previously used in cluster analysis of both abiotic and biotic systems.39,40",1

Steady-state velocity fields were solved based on a Darcy-Brinkman formulation.41 The domain of the porous medium without biofilm was modeled by the incompressible Navier-Stokes formulation\np(u·V)u = V·[−pI + μ(Vu + (Vu)™)] + F\np Vu = 0\nwhere p is the liquid density (1000 kg/m³), u is the fluid velocity, p is the pressure, I is the identity matrix, u is the dynamic viscosity (0.001 kg/m/s), and F = u is an\nKh\nadditional term accounting for the effect of the third dimension on the depth-averaged velocity. The latter term includes the drag force exerted on the liquid by the lower and upper boundary walls in the experiments.42,43 Kh is the permeability of a channel bounded by two parallel walls separate by a distance\nh²\n12\nh and can be approximated as K₁ = (in our system, h = 100\nμm and κ₁ = 8.3 × 10-10 m²).42\nThe Brinkman equation, which accounts for the flow transition from open flow to Darcy flow, is used to solve the flow through the biofilm, where\nпъ\n(u)u\npVu = Q\n1\nпъ\n=\nV.\nμ\n-pI +\nпъ\nVu+\n2 μ\n(Vu)I\n3 пъ\nμ\n+ φρlul +\nKbe\n(Vu)\n20\nu + F\nwith Q the flow rate, n₁ the porosity of the biofilm matrix, Khe the effective permeability of the biofilm matrix, and @ the parameter in the Ergun equations.

In our case, I, is the local normalized intensity, i.e., the intensity of a given pixel in the image, and the Lambert-Beer law reads\nln(I) = −e*·ch\nwith e* an absorption coefficient depending on the substrate, c the local mass per unit volume (i.e, at position (x, y)), and h the thickness of the substrate, or here the porous medium microfluidic device. As e* and h are considered constant, they can be combined into a single parameter d¯¹ = e* · h, eq 3 can then be rewritten as\nc = −8 ln (1)\nWith the assumption that c is inversely proportional to the local porosity n (see the SI for details), this yields a relation between the light intensity Is and the porosity n of the form\nn = (-ẞ ln(I))-1\nwhere ẞ includes the parameter d as well as the proportionality constant between c and n. Equation 5 has a comparable form to relationships established in previous work.47,48 The porosity n is related to the permeability k by a power law of the form 49,50\nκ = крп\nwith Kh being the permeability of the microfluidic channel. By combining eqs 5 and 6, we obtain the final model equation linking the permeability k and the normalized transmitted light intensity Is\n-α\nκ = κ₁ (-β In (1) + y)¯º\nwhere α, β, and y are parameters defining the shape of the function. The parameter y has been set as 1 to ensure that K = Kh for the maximum value of the normalized intensity Is, which corresponds to the case in which there is no biofilm, i.e., the pore space is empty and thus the permeability is K₁ = 8.3 × 10-10 m² (see Section 2.3.1).\nThe geometric mean of I, values within the biofilm for an image (i.e., time step) is expected to correspond to the value of Kbe. Using these values as data points for the derived model (five data points corresponding to five time points per experimental condition, SI Table S1), parameters α, β, and y in eq 7 were fitted for each experimental condition separately by nonlinear least-squares fitting. Three other generic models for permeability as a function of light intensity (linear, exponential, and power law) were also fitted for comparison to data from the baseline experiment (Section 2.1, and SI Table S2). All of the fitted models were then used to convert the relative intensities of the images to permeability fields at single-pixel resolution.",1

For observation and quantification of the behavior of large Trichodesmium aggregates, we built a custom imaging chamber that consisted of an opaque chamber (80 × 40 × 80 cm, L × W × H, with access provided by two doors on one side) that housed the sample, the imaging setup, and a temperature-controlled ventilation system. Images were obtained using a Canon EOS 80D camera with a fixed focal length objective (Canon EF-S 60mm) supported on a custom-built horizontal slider above a transparent sample table made from Plexiglas. The camera slider could be programmed to automatically image samples in wells sequentially with defined timing. Lighting was provided by a 30 × 60 cm LED panel (Epistar, 4000 K, 960 lm) placed 20 cm below the sample table. The LED light was synchronized with the 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle of the culture chamber, and during the dark phase flashed for only 100 ms for imaging. Temperature was maintained at 25 °C, so the conditions in the imaging chamber were very similar to the phytochamber, but without shaking. Imaging in this setup provided a field of view of around 3 × 2 cm. Cells were imaged in transparent multiwell polystyrene cell culture plates (Corning® Costar®, Merck) that were placed onto the sample table and photographed from above.  Microfluidic setup. For observation and quantification of single filament motility and filament– filament interactions, a microfluidic device was designed with four separate 8 × 8 mm chambers per microscope slide, each with an inlet and an outlet (Fig. S11). With a 2× objective, one image covered about 60% of a chamber. The chamber height of 85 µm was chosen to allow visual separation of filaments attached to the bottom or the top surfaces of the chamber by adjusting focus. To fabricate the microfluidic devices, a master was produced using standard photolithography techniques with Photoresist SU-8 3000 (purchased from KAYAKU Advanced Materials, .Inc). Individual microfluidic devices were made using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The PDMS was produced by mixing SYLGARD 184 (Dow Inc.) Base and Curing Agent (10:1 ratio), pouring the mixture onto the master, and baking it at 80 °C for at least 3 h. Once hardened, the PDMS was separated from the master and bonded to a microscope slide after plasma treatment. Filament behavior within the microfluidic chambers was imaged using a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with an Andor Zyla sCMOS camera and 2× Nikon Plan Apo λ objective at 0.05 fps. The imaging light intensity, provided by a CoolLED pE-100, was set to 0.6% with an exposure time of 2.2 ms. An additional LED light source mounted on one side was used to adjust the light intensity to that in the growth phytochamber. Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), measured using a light meter (WALZ ULM 500) with spherical sensor, varied between 50 and 78 μE, depending on measurement position (above or below the microfluidic chamber). The permeability of the PDMS upper surface of the microfluidic chambers allowed the exchange of gases. ","Completed Text: 1"

Description. Stationary phase (~3 weeks since the last dilution) T. erythraeum cultures that showed aggregation in the bulk (naturally aggregating cultures) were used without adding new medium or filtering the cells. The culture was shaken gently until aggregates were completely dispersed into filaments, 3 mL of the dispersed culture was transferred to triplicate wells (34.8 mm diameter) of a 6-well cell culture plate (Corning® Costar®, Merck) and allowed to sediment for 1 h, and then the wells were imaged every 2 min for up to 36 h in the imaging chamber at 25 °C. In the first 10 hours, the aggregates were left to re-form in the wells, before the actual experiments began. Filaments were then exposed to one of two different light switching treatments, superimposed on the 12 h:12 h light:dark cycle in which the cultures had been grown (Fig. 1). These two treatments/experiments were done in different weeks. Technical replicates were done during each experiment, by distributing the experimental culture into triplicate wells as mentioned above. In one treatment, the light phase was interrupted by three successive 2 h- duration LIGHT OFF phases, leading to a ~1 h LIGHT ON, 2 h LIGHT OFF rhythm. Some variation was added to the LIGHT ON phases, so that they varied between 40 and 70 min, to distinguish responses to light from any possible responses associated with a circadian rhythm. In the other treatment, the dark phase was interrupted by three successive ~1 h-duration LIGHT ON phases, leading to a similar ~1 h LIGHT ON, 2 h LIGHT OFF rhythm as for treatment 1, but superimposed on the *night* instead of the *day*. Note that the dark phase in the second treatment (Fig. 1D) actually starts with a 2h-duration light phase, which is not a light switch, but just an extension of the daytime light phase, and did not induce an aggregate response. Only one of the technical triplicates from each treatment was used to produce Fig. 1, since the aggregates in the wells behaved very similarly, and each well produced enough aggregates to produce meaningful data.To rule out the possibility that aggregates form and change shape or density passively, we performed an experiment comparing live and dead cells. For this, one well was filled with 3 mL of a dispersed filament sample and treated with 400,000 µJ UV in a Stratalinker. A second well was filled with a dispersed filament sample from the same culture without exposure to UV, and the plate was then imaged under constant light for 2 h. In contrast to the untreated culture, no aggregates formed in the UV-treated control, excluding purely physical explanations for aggregation.","Completed Text: 1"

Aggregates were then segmented using a global threshold on the pixel intensity values, which delineated aggregates well (Fig. S12). Segmented aggregates were hole-filled. For each detected aggregate, the weighted centroid position, pixel values, mean pixel intensity, area, eccentricity, aspect ratio, and pixel value sum were calculated. Aggregates with less than 2000 px² area and an eccentricity below 0.1 (almost perfectly round) were excluded.

Description. The rationale for this experiment was that the behavior that leads to aggregation should already be visible in the smallest possible aggregate – two encountering filaments. To characterize the motility of single filaments gliding on a surface and quantify their behavior upon encounter with a second filament, mid to late exponential cultures (13–14 d after last dilution) were imaged in the microfluidic setup for a minimum of 2 h, usually for around 4h, during the day. These cultures did not naturally aggregate. To investigate which aspects of motility change when a culture does aggregate, we split them into an experimental culture and a control culture and induced aggregation in the experimental culture by addition of 5 µM menadione as described in the section Culture of Trichodesmium erythraeum above. These cultures were then split further and imaged both in the microfluidic setup and the imaging chamber in parallel. The latter served as confirmation of successful induction of aggregation in the experimental culture and non-aggregation in the control culture. Filament densities in the microfluidic setup were deliberately chosen to be too low to observe aggregate formation, so that interactions of pairs of filaments could be studied. Control and experimental cultures were imaged in the imaging chamber in two neighboring wells of a 6-well plate, to confirm non-aggregation and aggregation, respectively. Aggregation was checked by direct observation, without image analysis. If the control aggregated or the menadione-induced sample did not aggregate, the experiment was discarded. We report data from 12 biological replicates and experiments performed over 6 weeks.","Completed Text: 1"

We restricted the analysis to tracks that were at least 50 frames (= 16 min) long. For example, to characterize the non-aggregating cultures, we obtained n = 776 individual tracks. To characterize the distribution of filament speeds, we combined time series representing speeds of individual filaments into a single time series (the resulting histogram of the filament speed is shown in Fig. S1A), which gave the reported mean speed and standard deviation. Once the mean filament speed had been obtained, it was used as a threshold to segment tracks into runs (segments with instantaneous speed greater than the mean) and reorientations (segments with instantaneous speed smaller than the mean) (Fig. 2A, Fig. S1E, F). In the non-aggregating control culture, segmenting the n = 776 tracks yielded n = 2416 runs and n = 1518 reorientations, which generated the distributions of run times, run lengths and reorientation angles (Fig. 2B,C, E; Table S1). Similarly, to estimate the reversal probability in a reorientation event, we combined all reorientation events from all tracks and treated them as independent events (Bernoulli trials). Each reorientation event was classified as a reversal if the reorientation angle was more than 90° and as a continuation of forward movement otherwise (Fig. 2C, Fig. S1G). The reversal probability was then estimated as the total number of reversals divided by the total number of reorientation events. To estimate the reversal frequency, we first computed the reversal frequency for each track, defined as the number of reversals divided by the track duration, and then averaged over tracks with weight proportional to the track length. The reported values for the mean and standard deviation of the reversal frequency are thus weighted by the track length. The motility of filaments in aggregating (menadione-induced) cultures were analysed analogously (Table S1).  To characterize the motility of filaments in pairs in a given condition, we started with the pool of tracks identified in the Python pipeline and then manually selected all tracks of filament pairs in which the filaments aligned with one another. For example, for the control, we obtained n = 79 pairs of such tracks representing pairs of aligned filaments (and thus n = 158 tracks in total, since there are two tracks per pair). We then segmented the tracks into runs and reorientations using the mean speed computed for the n = 776 tracks of individual filaments in the control [see code *analyze_pairs.m* in (61)]. That is, the speed threshold used to define runs and reorientations was the same for individual filaments and filaments in pairs. The analysis of the run times, run lengths and reorientations for filaments in pairs was then carried out in the same manner as for individual filaments.

That is, we excluded six pairs that were fully overlapped (Lack-of- overlap = 0) for the entire track duration since filaments in such pairs do not experience temporal changes in the overlap. Similarly, for the remaining n = 53 pairs, we restricted the Lack-of- overlap time series to non-zero values (|Lack-of-overlap| > 0) because only those instances where |Lack-of-overlap| > 0 correspond to changes in the overlap. Finally, each sample was then computed as the mean of the truncated time series of the absolute and non-zero values of the Lack-of-overlap.

Cells from these cultures were used for growth experiments in Tibbles Rawling (TR) minimal medium (40) containing either 0.1% (weight/volume) Polymeric alginate (Sigma Aldrich) or 0.1% degraded (d) alginate. D-alginate was produced by enzymatically degrading 2% alginate with 1 unit mL¯¹ of alginate lyase (Sigma Aldrich) at 37 °C for 24 h. Then, 100 mL of this mixture was generated, and the breakdown products have been measured previously with high-performance liquid chromatography to show that d-alginate contains a significantly higher amount of monomeric and oligomeric breakdown products of alginate than polymeric alginate (21). Carbon sources were prepared in nanopure water and filter sterilized using 0.40-µm Surfactant-Free Cellulose Acetate filters (Corning, USA). Well-mixed batch experiments in alginate or d-alginate media were performed in 96-well plates, and growth dynamics were measured using a micro-well plate reader (Biotek, USA).",1

Within the 5 × 5 array of ISCA wells, one full row of five wells was allocated to each compound as technical replicates. For experi-ments conducted in laboratory conditions, the chemoattractants were injected in triplicate ISCAs with a sterile 1mL syringe (Codau) and needle (27G, Henke Sass Wolf). Experiments were conducted by incubating the ISCAs for 1h in the bacterial cultures, which had pre-viously been diluted in artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) at a concentration of 106 cells mL¯¹. After this incubation time, the contents of the ISCA wells were retrieved with a sterile syringe and needle and transferred to 1 mL Eppendorf tubes, by pooling a row of 5 wells containing the same attractants. The samples were stained with SYBR Green I (Thermofisher) and the chemotactic response was quantified by counting cells using flow cytometry. For deployments conducted in situ, four ISCAs were deployed simultaneously to act as biological replicates. The ISCAs were placed into a flow-damping acrylic enclosure, following our pre-established procedure32,33. Each enclosure was filled with water coming from the four different mesocosm bags, previously mixed in equal volume. The flow-damping enclosures were filled slowly with water from the inlet in the lower surface, and were sealed with a plug once full. The enclosures were then incubated in situ for 2 h at 1 m depth. Following deploy-ments, enclosures were retrieved and slowly drained. The volume of each ISCA well was retrieved using a sterile 1 mL syringe and 27 G needle.

V. coralliilyticus YB2 has been used exten-sively in experiments with the ISCA32 and belongs to the family Vibrionaceae, which was highly enriched in ISCA wells containing phytoplankton-derived dissolved organic matter in previous in situ chemotaxis experiments. The strain was inoculated on Marine Agar plates (BD Difco) from a glycerol stock and incubated for 16 h at 30 °C. A single colony was then transferred to 10% Marine Broth (BD Difco) in 0.22-um-filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) and grown overnight at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. The culture was diluted 1/1000 (vol/vol) in 0.22-um-filtered artificial seawater to obtain the bacterial suspension used in the experiments. A concentration range was first tested under laboratory condi-tions for laminarin, glucose and mannitol. Each compound was resuspended at a concentration of 10 mg mL¯¹ in sterile-filtered artifi-cial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) and filtered with a 0.2 µm Millex FG filter (Millipore) to remove particles. The filtrates were then serially diluted from 10 mg mL¯¹ to 10 µg mL¯¹ (final concentra-tions). Each concentration was loaded into three different ISCAs using single-use 27 G needles (Henke Sass Wolf) connected to a 1 mL syringe (Codau). The ISCAs were incubated individually for an hour in the diluted V. coralliilyticus culture (see above) in 200 mL-capacity trays. The contents of the wells were retrieved and fixed with fil-tered glutaraldehyde (2% final concentration), and then cell con-centrations in the wells were quantified using flow cytometry (Fig. Sla-c and Supplementary Data 1). These concentration tests were carried out one more time at the field site before the start of the experiment.

Non-permeable uncovered seawater mesocosms (11 m³, 4 m deep and 2 m wide, 90% photosynthetically active radiation) were filled with seawater taken from the immediate surroundings in the fjord coastal environment. A phytoplankton bloom was induced artificially by adding phosphate and nitrate until day 7 and 5, respectively, and again on days 14-1734. The bags were sampled every day for 24 days, covering a set of 61 biogeochemical parameters34, including the quantification of bacteria and phyto-plankton by flow cytometry, and community composition via 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. ISCAs were deployed on days 0, 3, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 22, which covered the full phytoplankton bloom. For each deployment, meso-cosm water from the four bags was sampled, mixed in equal volumes and subjected to a quadruple-filtration process, where 50 mL was first filtered through a 0.2 µm Millex FG (Millipore) to remove large parti-cles, followed twice by a 0.2 µm Sterivex filter (Millipore) and then through a 0.02 µm Anatop filter (Whatman). This quadruple filtration aimed to remove all microorganisms from the seawater. The filtered seawater (FSW) was used as negative control in the ISCA, and was also used to resuspend the chemoattractants at their predetermined concentrations. Because we tested compounds of different sizes (glucose: 180.1, mannitol: 182.2, laminaribiose: 342.3, laminarin: 2900-6200 g mol¯¹), it was not possible to normalise the different compounds by weight,",1

Samples for flow cytometry were *flash thawed* at 40 °C, stained with SYBR Green I (1:10,000 final concentration; Ther-moFisher), incubated for 15 min in the dark, and finally analysed on a CytoFLEX S flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Forward scatter (FSC), side scatter (SSC) and green (SYBR Green) fluorescence were recorded for each sample. Bacterial populations were characterised according to SSC and FITC (SYBR Green) and cell abundance for each sample was determined by analysing a standardised volume of sample (30 µL). The chemotaxis strength (or chemotactic index, Ic) was calculated by dividing the number of cells found in the chemoattractant wells by the number of cells found in the filtered seawater wells. DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing and bioinfor-matics. DNA extraction from ISCA samples was performed using a microvolume DNA extraction approach (physical lysis method) 62. Libraries for 16S rRNA gene sequencing were generated for all samples using the Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina) following a previously described protocol for low-input DNA libraries 63. Primers targeting the v4-v5 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were used, namely 515 F (GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA) and 926 R (CCGYCAATTYMTT-TRAGTTT). Samples were then sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq plat-form. The sequencing run included a total of 69 samples: 29 ISCA samples from in situ deployments, 14 bulk seawater samples from the mesocosms and 24 controls (4 mock communities, 2 DNA extraction controls, 12 library prep controls, and 6 undeployed ISCA controls). These additional controls were used to identify and remove potential contaminants. Libraries were pooled on an indexed sequencing run and yielded -400 bp per sample. To characterise the composition of bacterial communities, reads were first trimmed with Seqtk64 and pair-end were merged with FLASH65. Adaptors were removed using CutAdapt66. Denoising, dere-plicating and taxonomy assignment were performed using DADA267. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene-based taxonomic profiles was performed in the software environment R68 with the phyloseq6 package, and on the MicrobiomeAnalyst 70,71 platform. Data were rarefied to 1021 reads per samples. To determine if statistical differences existed at the taxonomic level between treatments, we calculated Bray-Curtis similarity matrices on the relative abundance of rarefied reads. Permutational multivariate analyses of variance (PERMANOVA) were carried out using adonis function. Assessment of enriched taxa in laminarin treatments com-pared to the surrounding seawater was done using ANCOM-BC72. The 61 environmental variables were correlated with chemotactic indices induced by laminarin using Spearman*s correlation (two-sided) with adjusted p-values. Data handling and production of graphs was per-formed using the following R packages: ggplot2, vegan, ggpubr, dplyr, tidyr, tibble. Purification and identification of field isolates. To isolate chemo-tactic strains from each ISCA deployment, the 120 µL aliquots from the pooled wells of each chemoattractant from each ISCA were divided into six 20 µL aliquots and plated on 0.22-um-filtered environmental sea-water agar plates, amended with 1 mg mL¹ of the corresponding che-moattractant. The two set of triplicate plates were incubated at room temperature and at fjord water temperature (10 °C) until colonies appeared on the surface. Individual colonies were then grown in 10% Difco 2216 Marine Broth (BD Diagnostics) in autoclaved seawater overnight at room temperature and at 10 °C. Each isolate went through two additional rounds of purification via successive growth on plate and liquid cultures. In total 186 strains were isolated during the filed cam-paign.

At regular intervals after dilution (15-75 min), 45 µL of cell suspensions were placed in the centre of a chamber (created by fixing a coverslip on a standard microscopy slide separated by -1 mm of silicone rubber) and observed using phase contrast microscopy (Nikon) with a 20 × 0.45 NA objective (Nikon). Videos with acquisition speed 25-30 frames per second were recorded using a CMOS camera (Hamamatsu) for 30 s, with a resolution of 2044 × 2048 pixels (0.326 µm/pixel). Cell tracking was performed using TrackPy73,74 (v 0.5.0) after removing the background from each image by substracting the median image computed over the entire video. In the analyses, we allowed a max-imum displacement per frame of 31 pixels (corresponding to ~200 µm s¯¹) and minimum separation between particles of 51 pixels. Trajectories were corrected for drift and cell positions were averaged over a time window of 9 frames in our calculation of the speed. Cells with an average speed of less than 12 µm/s were classified as non-motile. For the calculation of the reorientation frequency, we used a similar approach as published previously75. The cellular positions processed with a second-order Savitzky-Golay filter with a time win-dow of 5 frames and the change in angle was computed from the filtered positional data. For each trajectory, time points where both (A) the minimal absolute change in angle exceeded 25° and (B) the filtered velocity was lower than 70% of the average velocity of the trajectory, were marked as reorientation events (Fig. S7). Minimal time between two reorientation events was limited to 2 frames (60-80 ms). The run time was defined as the time between detected reorientation events. The first run (from the start of the trajectory to the first event) and the last run (from the last detected event to trajectory length) were used as lower bounds estimates of the run time. The reorientation frequency per cell was calculated as the inverse of the mean average run time per cell.",1

Sequencing was performed at the Joint Microbiome Facility of the Medical University of Vienna and the University of Vienna (project ID JMF-2009-4) and at Microsynth (Austria). 16S rRNA genes were amplified by two-step PCR barcoding approach as previously described 60,61. The V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA genes were amplified with the primers 341F (5*-CCT ACG GGN GGC WGC AG-3*) and 785R (5*-GAC TAC HVG GGT ATC TAA TCC-3*) containing 16 bp head adapters (H1: 5*-GCTATGCGCGAGCTGC-3*, H2: 5*-TAGCGCACACCTGGTA-3*) and used in the first PCR step. Samples were then purified and normalized using a SequalPrep™ Normalization Plate Kit (Invitrogen). Afterward, a second barcoding PCR step was performed with unique dual barcodes (UDBs; Pjevac et al.60). Samples were again purified and normalized using a SequalPrep™ Normalization Plate Kit and pooled and concentrated on columns (innuPREP PCRpure Kit, Analytik Jena). Next, sequence libraries were prepared with the Illumina TruSeq DNA Nano Kit and sequenced in paired-end mode (2 × 300 nt; v3 chemistry) on an Illumina MiSeq. After sequencing, amplicon pools were extracted from the raw sequencing data using the FASTQ workflow in BaseSpace (Illumina) with default parameters, and then sequences were demultiplexed with the python package demultiplex by permitting one mismatch each for barcodes, linkers, and primers 60,61. 16S rRNA gene sequence data were processed into amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using the Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm (DADA2)62 applying the recommended workflow 63. FASTQ reads 1 and 2 were trimmed at 250 nt and 200 nt with allowed expected errors of 4 and 6, respectively. ASV sequences were subsequently classified using DADA2 and SILVA database SSU Ref NR 99 release 138 (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3986799).

Subsequently, 2 ml of substrates in D₂O (heavy water) were transferred into autoclaved Hungate tubes, incubated with 2 ml of fecal sample and 5 mM non-canonical amino acid L-azidohomoalanine (AHA) (Baseclick, Germany). The samples were incubated at a final volume of 4 ml in the presence of AHA (final concentration: 50 µM) and D₂O (final concentration: 50%). Samples were incubated in an anaerobic tent at 37 °C for 6 h. At the end of the incubation, the biomass was washed with PBS to remove traces of D₂O and AHA, and subsamples of the biomass (1 ml) were washed twice in PBS, fixed in ethanol: PBS (1:1) and stored at -20 °C. Further sample aliquots of 1 ml each were collected for nucleic acid extraction and metabolite analysis, and stored at -80 °C until further use. Samples were further stored in 20% glycerol/PBS in crimp-sealed vials with rubber stoppers and stored at -80 °C for further RACS experiments.",1

For sorting, the cells were thawed, pelleted by centrifugation (7 min, 7000-9000×g), washed twice with 0.3 M glycerol (balanced with MQ water; to minimize the osmotic stress on the cells), and then resuspended in 500 µl of 0.3 M glycerol. Cells of interest were identified and sorted using a platform that combines the Raman microspectroscope (532 nm at 90 mW), optical tweezers (1064 nm Nd:YAG laser at 500 mW), and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic device38,65. The microfluidic system has two outlets (each for a waste and a collection) and the sample stream is engineered to exit through the waste outlet by default. Individual cells are randomly captured within the sample stream using the optical tweezers and their Raman spectra are measured. Cells identified as D-labeled are translocated to a sample-free region (within the microfluidic device) and then released from the optical tweezers so that the flow carries them to the collection outlet for the collection, whereas cells identified as unlabeled are immediately released (without the translocation) to exit through the waste outlet and discarded. This process is fully automated using an in-house software written in MATLAB (version 4.2) and to this end the cell index Pc (which detects the capture of cells in the optical tweezers; PC = /1620-1670//fluid,1620-1670, where / refers integrated intensity within the specific spectral window; Pc >1 upon the cell capture) and the labeling index P₁ (which differentiates between D-labeled and unlabeled cells; PL =/2040-2300/ /1850-1900) are employed. The threshold value for P₁ = 5.7 was chosen on the basis of mean + 2 sd of the control sample incubated with inulin in a non-D2O-containing medium (i.e., water control) 38,65. After approximately 60-90 min, sorting was stopped and 50-60 µl liquid (containing the sorting cells) from the collection tube was collected in an Eppendorf tube, immediately introduced into an anaerobic tent and plated on rich media supplemented with 5 mg/ml glucose (YCFA-G, DSMZ 1611). Sorted samples were incubated at 37 °C until colony appearance on the plate. Single colonies were streaked on a new agar plate with YCFA-inulin (YCFA-IN) and incubated at 37 °C until new colonies were formed.

A pair of immiscible fluids were initially separated by a thin plastic foil that keep an approximately flat interface (Fig. 1A.1). To trigger the instability, the foil was rapidly removed. The time needed to completely remove the foil (~ 0.1 s) is negligible compared to the time scale of the instability, which is an essential factor to avoid any partial and asymmetrical overturning of the stratification. Conceptually, this method is similar to the one adopted in refs. 47–50, with two differences: i) Having a very thin foil, the fluid displacement in the wake of the moving membrane is less prominent so that the potential flow produced by the moving membrane is almost negligible and ii) the thin membrane can be very easily removed from the top aperture of the tank since the plastic foil can bend up and slide near the wall (see Sl Appendix for the drawings of the set-up). Nevertheless, the foil, by moving fast, generates two boundary layers on each side, introducing a shear perturbation at the interface between the two fluids conceptually similar to the mechanisms of a bursting bubble or a flapping flag (51). This mechanism perturbs the interface at every wavelength (Fig. 1A.2), but the surface tension smears out the short wavelengths. The turbulence then originates from large wave-length perturbation only (Fig. 1A.3), while smaller scale details grow at later times, as expected in RT turbulence. In order to measure the phase field, the laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) technique was employed. For this, a coherent laser sheet less than 0.5 mm thick was used to illuminate a slice that is orthogonal to the direction of the interface removal. To discriminate the fluids, the aqueous phase is colored with a fluorescent dye, emitting red light when illuminated by the green laser. The scene is recorded by a 1 megapixel high-speed camera running at 500 frames per second, equipped with a red filter in front of the objective so that only the fluorescent aqueous phase is visible. The camera was pointed right below the initial interface in order to observe at high enough resolution the lower half of the mixing zone. LIF requires refractive index (RI) matching of the two fluids to avoid undesirable blurring, while the physics requires matching kinematic viscosity to exclude asymmetries due to viscosity contrasts. These two conditions are achieved simultaneously by using a low viscosity and low refractive index silicon oil* (v = 2cSt, RI = 1.3925) in combination with a mixture of water, salt, and glycerol. We opted for a ternary mixture since it features two degrees of freedom in the RI v space, through which we are able to match simultaneously both the Rl and v of the silicon oil. The Rl – v matching results in a surface tension of y = 32.44 mN/m (measured with the pendant droplet method) and a density contrast of ∆p = 234 kg/m³. The densities of the ternary mixture and the oil are 1,113 and 879 kg/m³ respectively, resulting in a moderate Atwood number A = (Pmixture — Poil)/(Pmixture + Poil) = 0.12. The viscosity of the two fluids is further measured with a viscometer, resulting in a negligible viscosity contrast, and a mean kinematic viscosity of ~2cSt. We successfully matched the refractive index of different fluid pairs with low viscosity (mainly hydrocarbons such as hexane versus the water-salt-glycerol mixture), obtaining low viscosity contrasts (order unity) that can be used to explore different surface tension and density contrasts. Nevertheless, in this work, these substances have not been employed, due to their danger of ignition and toxicity. Since LIF allows to access only one slice of the volume, repetitions are needed to acquire converged statistics at each time-step. Note that some of the statistical properties of the emulsion are intrinsically three dimensional, and thus difficult to access through a two dimensional slice. However, the simulations provide both the three-dimensional phase field (Fig. 1B) and two-dimensional slices, allowing to quantify the reliability of the statistics calculated from the LIF data. Fig. 1 shows a comparison from the sliced phase field of the simulation (C.1) and the experiment (C.2), proving a good qualitative agreement. In order to estimate the 99th percentile droplet diameter from the LIF data, we considered all the oil-in-water and water-in-oil regions that were closed and disconnected from the others, and computed the equivalent two-dimensional droplet diameter. More details on the effect of slicing can be found in section 1.C of Sl Appendix. The interface area to volume ratio is evaluated in the two-dimensional slices as the length-to-area ratio of the interface. Finally, we employed the optical flow method to measure the interface velocity. This technique is based on the brightness constancy constrain, that relates the spatial and temporal derivative of the intensity of an image sequence to the two components of the apparent velocity. The brightness constrain alone is an under determined equation, in which the two unknowns (the two velocity components) are related by one equation only (the brightness constrain). Usually, a smoothness constrain is adopted to close the problem, which assumes that near-by patterns move coherently. Nevertheless, the smoothness constrain leads to a reduction of the final optical flow resolution. In our analysis, we opted to project the velocity field along the interface normal direction, and obtain the following equation for the interface-normal velocity component: Un = Un.\n|VI| a/ |VI| at*, where I(x, t) is the image intensity, and ∇ is the spatial gradient. By this approach we are able to measure the interface-normal velocity at close-to pixel resolution, at the expense of not retrieving the tangential velocity.",1

The flow field satisfies the following continuity and momentum equations: Vu = 0, dṭu + u • Vu = − −∇p + v∇²u + fy + b, where po is a reference density equal to the average density of the two fluids PAv = (P1 + P2)/2 and fy = ξγ/ροδsn is the surface tension force. The latter is proportional to the specific interface tension y / po and the local interface curvature §. n is the unit vector normal to the interface, and Ss is a Dirac function that turns on at the interface only. The term b is the buoyancy force. It is equal to ẞgce3, where ẞ is a constant equal to pav¯¹ap/ac, g is the gravitational acceleration, e3 is the vertical unit vector, and c is the scalar concentration, which obeys the following advection-diffusion equation (42): dtc + u • ∇c = D∇2c, where D is the molecular diffusivity of the scalar field. In order to locate the interface, the Multi-dimensional Tangent Hyperbola Interface Capturing (MTHINC) algorithm developed by li et al. (52) is adopted. In this regard, an indicator function H is needed to distinguish between the two phases, and obeys a pure advection equation. Initial and boundary conditions to produce RT turbulence mimic the simulations from Boffetta et al. (42) of miscible RT turbulence. Periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the lateral boundaries, while a free-slip condition is imposed on the lower and upper walls. The vertical scalar concentration profile is initiated as a step function of the form c = Ac/2(sign(z) + 1)), where Ac = β-1∆ρ/ρο. The interface is perturbed by adding 10% noise on the scalar field in the vicinity of the interface.

In the self-similar turbulent stage, the integral length-scale of turbulence L is proportional to the mixing layer thickness h, i.e. L~ h. Since the large-scale velocity fluctuations are of the same order of magnitude as the rate of expansion of the mixing layer, they grow linearly in time as u₁ = h dh/dt ~ Agt. To derive the scaling of the energy dissipation rate, we assume that the turbulence is in a state where the energy dissipation balances production locally in time. This implies that the average turbulent dissipation rate scales as e = v (Vu : Vu) ~ ư³/h ~ A²g²t, where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluids and ∇ is the gradient operator. This hypothesis, originally named *small scale adiabaticity* (58) has been validated in several DNSs studies by analyzing the temporal scaling of the turbulent energy dissipation rate (see, e.g., ref. 42) as well as in our simulations (SI Appendix). Provided that the energy dissipation rate scales linearly in time, the Kolmogorov length, represented by the orange continuous line in Fig. 1D, is given by η ~ v3/4 (Ag)-1/2 t-1/4. In the presence of a developed inertial range, the small-scale adiabaticity assumption can be extended to the energy flux at every scale, such that the velocity fluctuations within the inertial range adapt instantaneously to the large- scale evolution of the mixing layer. As a consequence, the velocity difference between two points in the mixing layer separated by a distance r at a given timet scales as su² ~ (er)2/3 ~ (Ag)4/3+2/3r2/3. Although surface tension prevents molecular mixing, the RT turbulence fragments the interface between the two fluids, generating an emulsion in which droplets of one fluid are dispersed into the other and vice-versa. Extending the adiabaticity assumption to the fragmentation process, the typical droplet diameter D can be estimated by balancing the interface energy density and the kinetic energy at scale D, namely y/D ~ ρδu² (D). As long as D lies within the inertial range of turbulence, we get the temporal evolution of the droplet size (azure dot-dashed line in Fig. 1D): D~ (γ/ρ)3/5 (Ag)-4/5-2/5. Even if Eq. 12 provides the temporal scaling of the typical droplet size, it lacks proper non-dimensionalization. To find an appropriate non-dimensionalization, we rely on the classical Kolmogorov/Hinze theory, stating that the maximum dropletsize is given by pyD/ μ² ,where u is the dynamic viscosity, p is the fluid mean density, and C is a constant of order unity (59–61). By substituting the scaling for e, we obtain the temporal scaling of D as a function of non-dimensional variables only: D/dH = (t/th)-2/5, where: dh = (v/p)-1v2, t = (γ/ρ)4 (Ag)-2 -5. Eq. 13 is the non-dimensional equivalent to [12] but is instead made non- dimensional in the Hinze/Kolmogorov fashion to represent the phenomenon through a single universal law, i.e., droplet dynamics of immiscible RT fully developed turbulence are expected to follow this law irrespective of the value of fluid viscosity, surface tension, and density. As shown in Fig. 1D, D decreases faster than n, so that at some time, the droplets size reaches the turbulence micro- scale, breaking the assumption that the droplet size belongs to the inertial range of turbulence (n < D < L). This happens at the time tӊ, at which we have that D(t = tx) = n(t = t₁) = d₁ (Fig. 1D). It is worth noting here that droplet inertial fragmentation is a dynamic process that, inherently, takes a finite time to occur. This fact could, in principle, limit the reliability of the adiabaticity assumption when extended to inertial-driven fragmentation. In their recent study, Vela-Martín and Avila (62) found that the breakup rate of droplets in stationary turbulence is proportional to the droplet diameter. Due to this reason, the adiabaticity hypothesis is expected to be more reliable for large droplets that can break up faster (see SI Appendix for a quantitative analysis of this point). Finally, we can formulate the scaling of the area-to-volume ratio assuming a dense emulsion, namely considering the inter-droplet distance to be of the same order of magnitude as the droplet diameter (Eq. 13). This gives the number of droplets within the emulsion, that is N ~ LxLyh/D³, where Lx and Ly are the horizontal dimension of the domain. Thus, the interface area-given by the number of droplets times the individual droplet surface area (proportional to D2)-scales as Aint ~ ND2 ~ LxLy (Ag)9/5 (γ/ρ)-3/5 t12/5. Given that the intruded volume is V ~ LxLyh, the area-to-volume ratio is: Aint/V~ (t/th)2/5 /dH.",1

The non-dimensional interface tension force is f* = *85(x*)n, where *δς(x*) = ξδς(x)/ho². Recalling that β∆c = ∆p/po, and that A = Δρ/(2ρο), the non-dimensional buoyancy force becomes b* = -e3c*. Using the same scaling, the advection-diffusion equation for the scalar field (Eq. 9) becomes dc + u* • ∇c* = 1 -2c* where Sc = v/D is the Schmidt number and represents the ratio between momentum and molecular diffusivity. It must be noted that, by rendering the equations non-dimensional with these scales, only two control parameters emerge, that are Reo and Sc. For an immiscible pair of fluid such as an oil- water system, the solubility of the two fluid is extremely low, such as Sc can be considered to be infinite, as no mass can diffuse across the interface. Reo remains, in fact, the only parameter controlling the overall behavior of the system, i.e., the existence, extent, and duration of capillary-driven turbulence at the interface.",1

V. ordalii was grown overnight for 20 h in 2216 medium on an orbital shaker (600 rpm) at 30 °C. The cells in late exponential phase (OD600 ≈ 1) were harvested, washed them with filtered autoclaved artificial water (salinity = 36 g kg-¹), and gently resuspended them for use in experiments to a final concentration of 5 x 107 cells mL-1 (at low concentration to allow the tracking of individual cells) in in the same water containing 1 mm 4-methoxy-7-nitroindolinyl-caged-L-glutamate (MNI-caged glutamate; Tocris Bioscience). The MNI-caged glutamate is a version of the amino acid glutamate - a chemoattractant for many bacteria - that is made undetectable to bacteria by caging, a chemical modification with a photo-removable protecting group. Prior to the chemotaxis experiments, the triple-porosity microfluidic model was filled with 1 mм MNI-caged glutamate in artificial water to allow it to diffuse into the hydrogel pillars for 20 min. During experiments, the dilute bacterial suspension (also containing MNI-caged glutamate) was injected at constant flow rate (10 µL min¯¹) using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus PHD). The mean swimming speed of V. ordalii (46.5 µm s¯¹) obtained by tracking single cells under still conditions (as described in [52]) was lower than the mean fluid flow velocity within the porous subdomain Γ1 (121 µm s¯¹) but higher than that in subdomain ₂ (10 µm s¯¹, Table 1). In the I₂ subdomain with fluid flow velocities lower than bacterial swimming speed, the migration of bacterial cells toward the chemoattractant was monitored. To create controlled, dynamic nutrient pulses that mimic those that bacteria might encounter in porous media, photolysis was employed to introduce and make almost instantly available to bacteria the amino acid glutamate with known concentration within a chemically dilute background.[52] By exposing the volume occupied by one hydrogel pillar to a focused LED beam (wavelength 395 nm) of the same diameter as that of the pillar, a controlled quantity of glutamate is photoreleased (*uncaged* by photolysis) from the MNI-caged glutamate in a vertical column. The amount of glutamate was controlled that was uncaged by tuning the exposure time of the LED pulse, as the two quantities are linearly related.[52] Application of the focused LED beam for a duration of 500 ms initiates rapid uncaging of the MNI-caged glutamate.[79] An LED pulse of 500 ms corresponds to a concentration of uncaged glutamate of Co = 35 μμ, obtained through a calibration scheme previously described.[52] In the experiments, considering the dimensions of the hydrogel pillar (diameter: 250 µm, height: 195 µm), this is equivalent to a pulse of 0.11 pmol. Following uncaging, glutamate diffuses out of the hydrogel pillar, triggering bacterial chemotaxis. The nutrient was retained by the hydrogel due to its low permeability (k = 10-13 m²) and exits the pillar mainly by diffusion,[80] creating a gradient around the hydrogel pillar that was deformed into a plume oriented downstream by advection from the surrounding flow (Figure 3a, Figure S1, Supporting Information). To calculate the spreading of the plume in the micromodel, the diffusivity of glutamate (molecular weight M = 147) in the artificial water was derived from the Stokes-Einstein equation,[81] which provides Dglu = 608 µm² s-¹ for our experimental conditions (dynamic viscosity = 1.0 × 10-3 kg m¯¹ s¯¹, salinity = 36 g kg-¹, temperature = 23 °C). To quantify bacterial chemotaxis, the microchannels were imaged on an inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti-E) in phase contrast, using a 10x (N.A. 0.30) objective. Videos were captured at a frame rate of 30 fps for 100 s with an sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu) controlled through Nikon Elements software. It began to acquire videos 10 s before the uncaging of glutamate to initially capture trajectories of bacteria that were not performing chemotaxis. The bacterial trajectories with custom MATLAB (Math- Works) scripts was reconstructed. From the reconstructed bacterial trajectories, accumulation profiles of bacteria within the plume were released from the pillar after the uncaging was extracted. The mean swimming speed, v = 46.5 µm s¯¹, of the bacteria was taken from previous work in which the cells were cultured and imaged under the same experimental conditions.[52]",NaN

Boes, Vicente Fernandez, Joël Wittmann, Markus Holzner, Davide Vanzo, Luiz G.M. Silva, Roman Stocker",Science of the Total Environment,Experimental procedures,"Experiments were conducted from July 10 to August 14, 2020, during daytime (09:00 to 18:00) in an indoor hydraulic flume (length 25 m, width 0.6 m, longitudinal slope 0.5 %) at ETH Zurich (ETHZ), Switzerland (Supplementary material, Fig. S3). Using a recirculation system, water was continuously pumped into an upstream tank, from which it flowed into the open-channel flume and subsequently into a downstream tank. By regulating the pump rate we controlled the discharge in the flume. To ensure reproducible operation, key variables such as the flow rate in the water recirculation pipe (MID), the water level in the upstream and downstream tanks (Keller, Series 36×), the water level in the experimental section (NivuCont Plus) and the water temperature (Sensirion, SHT21) were continuously monitored. To implement hydropeaking treatments (TR1 and TR2) (Fig. 1 D,E), we used an automated Labview interface to regulate the pump rate (Supplementary material, Fig. S4). During experiments, the water temperature was maintained at T = 12 ± 0.5 °C (identical to the husbandry tank) by a 20 kW cooling system (Clivet, KM Cool 20 CT), controlled by a thermostat. Flume water was replenished with tap water every three days and aeration stones were placed in the upstream tank to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations of 7–10 mg L-1 (WTW CellOx 325, galvanic, membrane based). To avoid possible effects of group size on behavior, and because trout parr are territorial (Kalleberg, 1958; Fausch and White, 1981), experiments were conducted with individual fish and each specimen was used only once. At the beginning of each experiment, a fish was captured in a bucket (4 L, avoiding direct air exposure) from the husbandry tank and placed within the bucked into the flume*s experimental arena nearby. After 5 min acclimation within the bucket, the fish was released into the experimental arena (see next section) and kept there for another 5 min at baseflow conditions (Q = 1.6 L s-1, Table 1). Thereafter, imaging was started, and the experimental arena was imaged for 20 min, constituting the acclimation phase (acclim), upon which the hydropeaking treatment begun. After completion of the treatment (62 min in TR1, 74 min in TR2), the fish was captured with the bucket and released in a dedicated compartment of the husbandry facility. Each run consisted of three steady baseflow periods (denoted by the letter *b*) and three steady peakflows periods (denoted by the letter *p*), connected by periods of unsteady discharge conditions or *ramping phases* (*up* for up-ramping; *d* for down-ramping). In this manner, one experimental run consisted of a sequence of sub-phases, as follows: acclim, up1, p1, d1, b1, up2, p2, d2, b2, up3, p3, d3, b3.",1

Silva, Roman Stocker",Science of the Total Environment,Experimental arena,"To allow for visual tracking of fish, a semi-transparent, laterally in-clined (lateral slope = 14%) gravel bed (Fig. 1 A,B) was fitted into a central section (length 1.6 m, width 0.6 m) of the flume (Supplementary material, Figs. S2A, S5). Its development was driven by three design criteria: (1) create sufficient visual contrast for automated fish-tracking based on imaging fish from above through the water surface (Fig. 1C); (2) avoid shining strong artificial light on fish so as not to impact their behavior; and (3) mimic a heterogeneous gravel bed with a lateral gradient of water depth and flow velocity. To avoid fish being disturbed by their own reflection at the glass walls, the latter were covered with perforated foil. To confine the experimental arena, honeycomb flow straighteners (diameter = 0.5 cm) were placed before the upstream and after the downstream ends of the arena. To increase the contrast between fish and background, we fabricated a translucent gravel bed by partly embedding glass gravel pebbles (length = 2-2.4 cm; diameter = 0.6-0.8 cm) into an epoxy layer. The arena was illuminated with infrared light (IR-light) from under-neath the flume, using four LED strips emitting at wavelengths above 750 nm. The IR-light penetrated the glass bottom, a diffusor material, a color foil and the translucent gravel layer (Fig. 1A). A fish located in the arena appeared as a dark object in the image (Fig. 1C) as a result of preventing IR-light from reaching the camera. IR-light was used as the main light source since it is not visible for many fish species, including Salmo trutta (Bowmaker and Kunz, 1987), and has increasingly been used to observe fish behavior (Pautsina et al., 2015; Kerr et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2018). The color foil was fully translucent for infrared light (λ > 750 nm), yet absorbed light in the visible spectrum (*λ = 400-700 nm). Consequently, the gravel bed appeared dark for fish (and humans) in the",1

The instantaneous velocity com-ponents u(t), v(t), w(t) were collected at a temporal resolution of 100 Hz and post-processed based on a standard procedure implemented in py-thon (Agarwal et al., 2021). The lateral inclination of the flume bed resulted in a lateral water-depth gradient of 14% in the direction perpendicular to the main flow direction. Thus, during baseflow conditions (Qbase = 1.6 L s-1; phases acclim, b1, b2 and b3), two thirds of the experimental arena was submerged, the averaged bulk flow velocity was Vbulk = 8.1 cm s-1, and the water depth h varied laterally from 0 cm to 6.5 cm.

Silva, Roman Stocker",Science of the Total Environment,Experimental treatments,"Experiments were performed using one fish at a time, therefore single individuals constitute a true replicate. We aimed to achieve meaningful statistical power while reducing the ethical burden of ani-mal experimentation by using sample sizes consistent with previous behavioral studies in hydraulic flumes Boavida et al., 2017). The vari-ation in sample size across treatments was caused by limited availability of wild-caught trout. We defined two experimental treatments (TR1 and TR2) based on the ramping rate dh/dt that fish experienced during phases of flow transition (TR1: dh/dt = 2 cm min-1; TR2: dh/dt = 6 cm min-1). The two ramping rates were selected to study the impact of hydropeaking events of different severity on juvenile Brown trout, during daylight, guided by the Swiss hydropeaking mitigation guidelines (Tonolla, 2017). The range of water depth and bulk flow velocities during baseflow and peakflow were within the suitable habitat criteria of brown trout parr (Armstrong et al., 2003), mimicking local habitat conditions along the river shore. An experimental run consisted of an acclimation phase at baseflow (20 min) followed by three consecutive and identical hydropeaking events, each consisting of up-ramping (3 min in TR1; 1 min in TR2), peakflow (p1, p2 and p3: 6 min each), down-ramping (3 min in TR1; 1 min in TR2) and baseflow (b1, b2 and b3: 6 min each) (Fig. 1D,E, Supplementary material, Fig. S4).

With the cameras placed at a distance of 1.7 m from the arena, this yielded a resolution of 13.5 pixels/cm and a maximum refractive displacement error of ARmax = 0.9 cm (Naudascher et al., 2024 in preparation). To prepare images for tracking, custom-made Python scripts were devel-oped (openCV library; Bradski, 2000) and are available through a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/naroberto/hydropeaking). Thereby, the two camera views were merged into one image, rotated and cropped (python functions: cv2.FlannBasedMatcher, cv2.getRota-tionMatrix2D, cv2.warpPerspective). The goal of this pre-processing was to homogenize image size, orientation and origin of the coordi-nate system across experimental runs. As water absorbs infrared light, the water-level change during the ramping phase caused a substantial variation in illumination. Therefore, a moving background subtraction was applied to each image during the ramping phase, allowing to sub-stantially reduce background noise and enhance visual contrast. To",1

Although fish occupancy may have been influenced by the downstream and upstream baffles or proximity to glass walls (i.e., thigmotaxis or wall-holding and tail-holding as described in Kerr et al., 2016), this ef-fect was consistently present across all treatments and flow conditions. Therefore, we did not exclude these zones from our analysis. We normalized the occupancy values by dividing each value by the average occupancy across the entire arena (minus the area covered by cobbles), so that areas with values above one denote higher-than-average occu-pancy.

The deep learning-based segmentation tool Dragonfly (82) was used for the segmentation of IsoNet-corrected (83) tomograms.  For subtomogram averaging of T6SS baseplates and transenvelope complexes, T6SSs were manually identified in individual tomograms, and their long axes were modeled in 3dmod (80) to generate model points and an initial motive list. Initial averages that were used as subsequent first references were created with PEET (84). Afterward, particles were extracted, aligned, and averaged with Dynamo (85). The 4 x 4-binned particles were aligned for 12 iterations (box size: 88 pixels³). Afterward the datasets were split in half for gold-standard Fourier shell correlation (GSFSC) calculations, and masks focusing either on the baseplate or the transenvelope complex were used for alignments, respectively. Independent alignments were repeated for eight iterations using 2 × 2-binned tomograms (box size: 176 pixels³). The set of particles was cleaned according to cross-correlation values, and another eight alignment iterations were performed followed by a final alignment with tight masks generated by Relion*s mask generator (86).

Automatic data collection was carried out using the Thermo Fisher Scientific EPU software. The scheme of four shots per hole was applied during data collection in counting mode, at a pixel size at specimen level of 1.065 Å/pixel and a defocus range of -1 to -2.5 µm. The total dose was 50 e¯/A² over 40 frames and 2-s exposure time.  The movies were motion-corrected using MotionCor2 (88). The resulting micrographs were imported into CryoSPARC v.4 (89), and the contrast transfer function (CTF) estimated using the patch CTF estimation tool. Grappling hook stem particles were picked manually, with a box size of 300 pixels, and averaged using 2D classification. The three best classes were then used as references for the filament tracer tool (filament diameter = 100 Å, interbox distance = 130 Å), which picked 2,452,192 particles. The particles were extracted with a box size of 300 Å, binned to a pixel size of 3.8 Å. During 2D classification, recentering after each iteration was not allowed, and a mask with a diameter of 90% of the box size was applied. After two rounds of classification and removal of bad classes, 1,309,380 particles of the stem remained.  The refinement was carried out without imposing helical symmetry. 3D classification, using real-space windowing of 0.75 to 0.9, was carried out with a target of five classes and a maximum resolution of 7 Å. The two classes with the most particles were refined individually. Particles were reextracted at a pixel size of 1.68 Å and subjected to helical refinement, applying a mask covering the central 50% of the map, 2D classification and 3D classification with a target resolution of 4 Å. A 50% mask was then applied to all other refinement jobs. An iterative process of 3D classifications, with a target resolution of 3.5 Å, helical refinement, nonuniform refinement (90), and global and local CTF refinement on unbinned particles resulted in six structures with resolutions between 3.4 and 3.7 Å. A graphical depiction of the workflow is shown in fig. S5.  For data processing of the grappling hook distal and proximal ends, terminal segments were identified visually from the filament tracer tool output and reextracted with a box size of 800 pixels and a binned pixel size of 4.26 Å, resulting in 78,681 particles. 2D classes were inspected manually and divided into two categories, referred to as *base* and *neck* classes, which were processed independently. C7 symmetry was applied in the refinement of both classes. Ab initio refinement was performed to obtain initial volumes, which were improved upon through an iterative process of 2D classification and homogeneous, nonuniform (90), and CTF refinement (all using the parameters described above). At the end of this process, the neck structure reached a global resolution of 3.77 Å, whereas the base structure reached 3.73 Å. A graphical depiction of the workflow is shown in fig. S6.  Global resolutions were determined by GSFSC, as estimated by CryoSPARC at a threshold of 0.143 (fig. S7). Local resolution was estimated at a GSFSC threshold of 0.143 across the entirety of the map and visualized in ChimeraX (87) (fig. S7). Finally, nonuniform refinement was run again on each of the final maps without imposing symmetry of any kind (C1). Unless stated otherwise, all data processing steps were carried out using the CryoSPARC v4 default settings.

The amplicon reads (SRR5175890 to SRR5175997 and SRR5176042 to SRR5176255) were previously determined and analyzed following the methods described in (47). Coupled dynamics were analyzed by determining the Pearson correlation coefficient for the relative abundance of each amplified sequence variant of the Saprospiraceae and Vibrionaceae on each day of the Nahant time series, taking into account time-lagged correlations due to predator-prey dynamic by smoothing the abundance data by a rolling average over 7 days. The threshold for significance of correlations was set to 0.03. The difference between the smoothed and direct correlation coefficient was determined, and the 95th percentile calculated. Every correlation above this threshold was stated as significant. To validate correlations, the values for the Vibrionaceae abundance were 1000 times permuted, and for each permutation, the Pearson correlation coefficient and the P value were determined and their mean calculated. In addition, the number of correlations above the previous determined 95th percentile per 1000 permutations and P values greater than 0.03 per 1000 permutations were calculated. The DNA used for amplicon preparation was also used for metagenomic sequencing. A subset of samples (Julian days 231, 235, 237, 239, 241, 243, and 247) were library prepped and sequenced by the BioMicroCenter (MIT, Cambridge, MA) on an Illumina NextSeq flowcell. Samples of each day were library prepped and sequenced by the BioMicroCenter (MIT, Cambridge, MA) using an Illumina NovaSeq S1flowcell. The relative abundances of genomes were determined as follows: Reads were (i) cleaned of phiX with bowtie2 (v. 2.3.4.2) (96) and quality trimmed with trimgalore (v.0.5.0) (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore) with the parameters *-e 0.05 -clip_R1 1 -clip_R2 1 -three_ prime_clip_R1 1 -three_prime_clip_R2 1 -length 70 -stringency 1 -paired -max_n 1 -phred33.* (ii) Error correction was done with Tadpole (v. 38.18, BBTools package; https://jgi.doe.gov/data-and-tools/software-tools/bbtools/). (iii) Reads were filtered using kraken2 (v.2.1.3) (97) classification (bacteria and archaea). (iv) Mapping was performed with bbmap (v.39.01) (BBTools package) to genomes with the parameters *fast=t minid=0.95 idfilter=0.98* and results sorted with samtools (98). For prey relative abundance, the reads were mapped to all available RefSeq genomes of the Vibrionaceae (218, NCBI, Nov. 2023) and summed. For the ixotrophy-positive strains, Saprospira grandis str. Lewin (GCF_000250635.1), Aureispira sp. CCB-QB1 (GCF_000724545.1), Saprospira sp. CCB-QB6 (GCF_028464065.1), and Aureispira sp. CCB-E (GCF_031326345.1) were analyzed and as control the ixotrophy-negative strain A. machipongonensis (GCF_000166275.1). Plots were done with RStudio and smoothed by a rolling average of 3.

Cells from these cultures were used for growth experiments in Tibbles Rawling (TR) salts minimal medium (Hehemann et al., 2016; Tibbles and Rawlings, 1994) containing either 0.1% (weight/volume) algae-derived alginate (referred to as *alginate*; Sigma-Aldrich, CAS-number 9005-38-3) or 0.1% (weight/volume) digested alginate. At these concentrations, both alginate and digested alginate are soluble in the culture medium. The digested alginate was produced by enzymatically digesting 2% alginate with 1 unit ml-¹ of alginate lyase (Sigma-Aldrich, CAS-number 9024-15-1) at 37 °C for 48 hr. In our experiment we used 1 unit/ml of alginate lyases in a 4.5 ml solution to digest the alginate. As the commercially purchased alginate lyases are 10,000 units/g, our 4.5 ml solution contains 0.45 mg of alginate lyase protein. The digested alginate solution diluted 45 x when added to culture medium. This means that we added 0.18 µg alginate lyase protein to 1 ml of culture medium. Based on the above calculation, we conclude that the amount of protein added to the growth medium by the addition of alginate lyases is so small that we consider it negligible. As a comparison, for 1 ml of alginate medium, 1000 µg of alginate is added or for 1 ml of Lysogeny broth (LB) culture medium, 3,500 µg of LB are added. Thus, the amount of alginate lyase protein that we added is ca. 5000–20,000 times smaller than the amount of alginate or LB that one would add to support cell growth. Therefore, we expect the growth that the digestion of the added alginate lyases would allow to be negligible. Carbon sources were prepared in nanopure water and filter sterilized using 0.40 µm Surfactant-Free Cellulose Acetate filters (Corning, USA). Well-mixed batch experiments in alginate or digested alginate medium were performed in 96-well plates (Greiner Bio) and growth dynamics were measured using a microwell plate reader (Biotek, USA).

We used a solvent trap to avoid sample evaporation during measurement. The temperature was set to 25 °C using a Peltier element. We measure the dynamic viscosity over a range of shear rates = 0.1-100 s-1. We report the viscosity of each solution as the average viscosity measured over the shear rates 10–100 s-1, where the shear-dependence of the viscosity was low. We measured the viscosity of 0.1% (w/V) alginate dissolved in TR media, which was 1.03+/-0.01 mPa·s (reporting the mean and standard deviation of three technical replicates.). The viscosity of 0.1% digested alginate in TR media was found to be 0.74+/-0.01 mPa·s.

Once the ISCA is deployed in an aqueous environment, the chemicals diffuse out of the wells through a small port, creating chemical gradients which will guide chemotactic bacteria inside the wells of the device (Lambert et al., 2017; Clerc et al., 2020). Vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF210 was plated on Marine Agar (BD Difco) from a glycerol stock and grown for 16 hr at 27 °C. A single colony was then incubated in 10% Marine Broth (BD Difco) in 0.22 µm filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) and grown overnight at 27 °C and 180 rpm. The culture was diluted down to 1x106 cells ml-¹ in 0.22 µm filtered artificial seawater (Instant Ocean, Spectrum Brands) to perform the chemotaxis experiment.

Within the ISCA, one full row of five wells was used per chemoattractant as technical replicates. The chemoattractants were injected in triplicate ISCA with a sterile 1 ml syringe (Codau) and needle (27 G, Henke Sass Wolf). A last row containing 0.2 µm-filtered seawater acted as negative control accounting for cells swimming in the device by random motility only. Experiments were conducted by incubating the ISCAs for 1 hr in the diluted Vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF270 culture. Upon time completion, a sterile syringe and needle were used to retrieve the content of the wells and transferred to 1 ml microfuge tubes resulting in a pooling of a row of five wells containing the same sample. Sample staining was performed with SYBR Green I (Thermo Fisher) and the chemotactic response was quantified by counting cells using flow cytometry. The strength of the chemotactic response was determined by the mean chemotactic index (Ic), defined as the ratio of the number of cells found in each chemoattractant to the number of cells in control wells containing filtered seawater (so that attraction corresponds to Ic >1).",1

Preprocessing of the raw reads was carried out as follows: Quality control was performed with FastQC (v0.11.9) Andrews, 2010 and reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.38) Bolger et al., 2014; the high-quality reads were mapped to the reference genome (described above) with Bowtie2 (v2.3.5.1) Langmead and Salzberg, 2012; binarization, sorting, and indexing were done with Samtools (v1.10) Danecek et al., 2021; gene counts were computed with the featureCount function of Subread (v2.0.1) (Liao et al., 2014). Differential expression analysis was performed with DESeq2 (v1.30.1) (Love et al., 2014). In brief, DESeq2 normalizes the raw read counts with normalization factors (*size factors*) to account for differences in sequencing depth between samples. Subsequently, gene-wise dispersion estimates are computed for each gene separately using maximum likelihood, and then shrunk toward the values predicted by the dispersion-mean dependence curve to obtain final dispersion values. Finally, DESeq2 fits a negative binomial model to the read counts and performs significance testing using the Wald test. Here reported p-values result from the Wald test of read counts from the digested alginate condition compared to the alginate condition and were adjusted for multiple testing by Benjamini-Hochberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) as implemented in the p.adjust function of base R (v4.1.2). The reported log2 fold changes indicate the log2(DESeq2-normalised reads in digested alginate condition / DESeq2-normalised reads in alginate condition) for each gene. Visualization of gene maps was performed in R with the ggplot2 package (v3.4.0) and the extension gggenes (v0.4.1) by David Wilkins. For systematic functional analysis we performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005) using the fgsea function of the fgsea package (v1.20.0) with minimal number of unique genes per gene set *minSize*=5 and number of permutations *nPermSimple*=1000000. In brief, GSEA takes the full gene list ranked by log2 fold change and annotated with K numbers as input and determines whether the member genes of any KEGG pathway are randomly distributed throughout the ranked gene list or whether they are primarily found at the top or bottom (Subramanian et al., 2005). This is quantified by the enrichment score (ES), which corresponds to a weighted Kolmogorov-Smirnov-like statistic. The ES of each gene set is normalized to the mean enrichment of random samples of the same size to account for the size of the set, yielding the normalized enrichment score (NES). To estimate the significance level of the enrichment score, the p-value of the observed enrichment score is calculated relative to a null distribution that was computed from permuted data. The estimated significance level was adjusted to account for multiple hypothesis testing. As gene sets we chose all KEGG pathways and KEGG BRITE categories (as noted in Supplementary file 1 in column *KEGG_pathway*) within all genes of V. cyclitrophicus ZF270 annotated with a KEGG Ontology identifier (*K number*). Visualization of differential expression levels in KEGG pathways was performed with the R package pathview (v1.35.0) (Luo and Brouwer, 2013). We also formed gene sets of the genes associated with alginate utilization (see *Sequencing and gene annotation of Vibrio cyclitrophicus ZF270*, Supplementary file 16), of the genes of the flagellar locus that map to the KEGG pathways *Bacterial motility proteins*, and of the genes of the flagellar locus that map to the KEGG pathways *Bacterial chemotaxis* (as noted in Supplementary file 17) within all genes of V. cyclitrophicus ZF270.",1

To deposit the optode material, a 10% w/v solution of PS in toluene containing 0.15 g L¯¹ of both MY and PtTFPP was spread on the glass microwell array via a thin film applicator. The homogeneity of the optode coating was assessed by profilometry (see ESI† for details), which revealed that it had a nominal thickness of 5 µm and was most uniform in the central region of the array. Therefore, we prioritized this central area (containing at least 200 microwells) for seeding cells and investigating their O2 consumption. As the deposited optode material is hydrophobic, the array was briefly treated with O2 plasma (Zepto, Diener electronic, Ebhausen, Germany) for 10 s at 0.4 mbar and 50% intensity to promote filling of microwells with culture medium and assist in cell adhesion. This plasma treatment did not affect the response of optode materials to 02. To avoid undesired background fluorescence, the optode material deposited outside of the microwells was removed using a scalpel. This process resulted in two regions with different wettability, i.e., (i) hydrophilic microwells containing a layer of optode material (yellow regions in Fig. 2A) surrounded by (ii) hydrophobic glass (gray regions in Fig. 2A).",1

Following optode deposition, a calibration curve was constructed by averaging data acquired from 216 central microwells. To perform calibration measurements, the optode-coated array was placed into a gas-impermeable chamber with a transparent window for image acquisition. The chamber was placed in a microscopy incubator (Okolab srl, Pozzuoli, Italy) maintained at 37 °C, to avoid temperature fluctuations which might influence optode responses (Fig. S2†). Optode emissions were recorded via a fully automated fluorescence microscope (Nikon Ti2-E, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an RGB camera (DFK 33UX264 colour industrial camera, The Imaging Source) and a LED excitation light (Spectra X, Lumencor, OR, USA). Calibration was performed introducing gases at five different levels of O2 saturation by combining compressed air and nitrogen (N2) through a gas mixer set up (Red-y smart series mass flow meters, Voegtlin GmbH, Muttenz, Switzerland). This system enabled modulation of the partial pressures of the mixture components by tuning the flow rate from their sources. The stability of air saturation within the sealed chamber was verified by monitoring it with a calibrated optical microsensor (OXR250, Pyroscience GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Images of single microwells were acquired with a 40x objective. All other imaging parameters were set as listed in Table 1 for monitoring cellular O2 consumption. A simplified form of the two-site model (eqn (2))27-29 was then fitted to collected datapoints in order to derive average calibration parameters for the specific array - i.e., the Stern-",1

Human hepatic cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2 cells, ATCC, Manassas, Virginia, USA) were maintained in T25 flasks (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) under standard conditions (37 °C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2). Fresh Dulbecco*s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri, USA) supplemented with 10% v/v foetal bovine serum (FBS - Sigma-Aldrich) was supplied every 3 days. Before experiments, cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). After optode calibration, the central area of the microwell array was overlaid with a thick poly-dimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) frame into which 500 µL of cell suspension in DMEM was pipetted. This allowed control of the seeding density and ensured that cells were confined to the region where the optode coating was determined to be homogeneous. Experiments were performed with different seeding densities, ranging from 2 × 103 cells per mL up to 10º cells per mL. The former resulted in an optimal trade-off between acceptable number of microwells containing single cells and minimal lateral O2 diffusion between neighbouring microwells. Following cell seeding, the device was incubated overnight to allow cell adhesion to the microwells (Fig. 2C).",1

Immediatly before O2 consumption experiments, the culture medium within the PDMS frame was changed and 60 µL of fresh DMEM was dispensed into the microwells. Then, the PDMS frame was removed and microwells seeded with cells were covered with a coverslip, which was affixed to the array via both paperclips and magnets (Fig. S1†). A thin coating of heavy mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) was applied to the underside of the coverslip to isolate the microwells from environmental O2 (Fig. 1) and to define the initial and boundary conditions of the system. Mineral oil has a significantly lower O2 diffusion coefficient than aqueous media³⁰ and effectively seals off the array from ambient O2, allowing a hypoxic steady state to be reached a necessary condition to properly characterize the MM consumption kinetics, particularly km (see subsection Modelling single-cell consumption). The ratio of mineral oil to cell culture media was optimized to ensure maximal phase separation and minimize lateral (i.e., inter-well) O2 diffusion and, at the same time, guarantee that cells are exposed to the medium phase within microwells (see ESI5† for details). Image acquisition was started immediately after device assembly to ensure rapid monitoring of O2 dynamics (i.e., from the initial condition of maximum O₂ in the medium to the achievement of stationary hypoxia, defined as c ≤ 0.04 mol m³ (ref. 31)). Measurement duration and sampling frequency were set according to instrument limits and modelling considerations (see subsection Modelling single-cell consumption). The O2 dynamics associated with cell consumption were measured by repeatedly scanning the central area containing cells, using large area scanning mode. Briefly, this mode allows for the acquisition of a matrix of images (referred to as large image) covering 216 microwells, that are serially acquired according to a raster scanning path defined by means of the spatial coordinates of its centroid. The large image acquisition parameters are listed in Table 1. Following each experiment, 30 µL of trypan blue dye (0.4% w/v solution, Sigma-Aldrich) was gently pipetted through the gap between the microwell array and the coverslip. Trypan blue was left to diffuse over the array for about 10 min, then a brightfield large image was acquired setting the same scanning pathway as used during experiments. This procedure enabled identifying Ncell in each microwell and estimating cell size (i.e., the projected area) using ImageJ.32 Determination of concentration profiles. Time series of large images were processed exploiting algorithms purposely developed in Matlab (R2021b, MathWorks, Massachusetts, USA). Briefly, each RGB image was segmented by means of customized thresholding to distinguish PtTFPP-decorated microwells from the background. This allowed for the computation of the pixel-by-pixel R. Finally, for each microwell, R profiles were determined over time by averaging over pixels belonging to the same microwell. This allowed for conversion of R signals into O2 concentrations using previously established calibration curves.",1

Silicon (Si) wafers (Wafer World, test grade) were coated with P4VP or the copolymer of 4VP and DVB without pre-treatment. Prior to deposition, commercial RO membranes (Koch Membrane System, TFC-HR) were cleaned with filtered nitrogen, and then treated with oxygen plasma for 1 minute and then placed in the reactor chamber. The glass slides were treated with trichlorovinylsilane (Aldrich, 97%), as described previously. [34] During iCVD depositions, 4VP (Aldrich, 95%) and DVB (Aldrich, 80%) monomers were heated up to 50 *C and 65 *C in glass jars, respectively and delivered into the reactor using mass flow controllers (1150 MFC, MKS Instruments). Argon patch flow was metered into the reactor through a mass flow controller (1479 MFC, MKS Instruments) and the flow rate was varied to keep the residence time constant. Systematic variation of the flow rate ratios of the two monomers was performed to yield high-zwitterionic-percentage, yet chlorine-resistant films of poly(4-vinylpyridine-co-divinylbenzene) (PVD).

Water samples were returned to the Heron Island Research Station laboratory and used immediately (within 10 min) for chemotaxis experiments. In these laboratory experiments, we examined chemotactic responses using a modified version of the capillary assay (Pfeffer, 1884; Adler, 1973), whereby sterile 1-ml syringes were filled with 150 µl of putative chemoattractant. Syringes were inserted into 100-ml vials containing seawater collected from the environment (Dennis et al., 2013). Each of three replicates involved a single syringe being inserted into one vial of seawater. Once placed into the vial of seawater chemo-tattractants diffused out of the syringe into the seawater suspension, and chemotactic bacteria within the seawater migrated into the syringe. Putative chemoattractants were selected according to their relevance as components of coral mucus (Von Holt and Von Holt, 1968; Muscatine and Cernichiari, 1969; Ducklow and Mitchell, 1979b; Meikle et al., 1988; Hill et al., 1995; Fitzgerald and Szmant, 1997; Broadbent et al., 2002; Broadbent and Jones, 2004; Wild et al., 2005, 2010; Raina et al., 2009, 2010) and included a suite of amino acids, carbohydrates, dimethylsulfonipropionate and filtered seawater (FSW) (Supplementary Information).",1

To examine coral-microbe chemotaxis within the natural coral reef environment, we complemented the laboratory experiments with in situ chemotaxis measurements, using a newly developed microfluidic-based platform, the ISCA. The ISCA was engineered using soft lithography techniques (Whitesides et al., 2001; Seymour et al., 2008) to create a high-throughput method for chemotaxis quantification in situ, allowing for the simultaneous and replicated testing of multiple chemoattractants under identical conditions, as well as on-chip controls. Each ISCA consists of a matrix of 24 cylindrical wells embedded within a ~30-cm² slab of the soft, inert polymer polydimethylsiloxane. Each well has a diameter of 10 mm and a height of 1 mm, resulting in a volume of ~80 µl. Each well has two 1-mm diameter, 5-mm-high ports, which are openings connecting the interior of the chamber to the external environment. Individual wells are filled with 80 µl of putative chemoattractant using a pipette. Over the course of a 30-min deployment, the chemoattractant gradually leaks into the external environment through the two inlet ports via molecular diffusion, creating a gradient in the surrounding seawater that triggers the migration of chemotactic bacteria into the wells. ISCA deployments were conducted 1 year subsequent to the laboratory experiments. The short branches of P. damicornis (used in the laboratory experiments) prevented the placement of ISCAs in between the coral branches, meaning that non-intrusive ISCA experiments close to the surface of this coral species were not possible. Consequently, we focussed this component of the study on the abundant coral species Acropora aspera and A. palifera, which have a more deeply branching structure that allowed for ISCAs to be placed in between coral branches (Supplementary Figure S2). ISCAs were deployed on the surface of A. aspera, located on Heron Island reef crest, and on the surface of A. palifera within lagoon (Supplementary Figure S1). These coral species represent the dominant species within these two regions of Heron Island reef (Wild et al., 2004). For each coral deployment, ISCAS were carefully inserted into the coral branches (Supplementary Figure S2), so that the wells were facing away from the centre of the coral. ISCAs were also deployed on the sandy substrate within Heron Island lagoon and within open water away from any coral (Supplementary Information; Supplementary Figure S1). We now describe the bacterial communities inhabiting each of these environments as *coral-associated* and *non-coral-associated* bacteria, respectively. For each water-type tested, two ISCAs were deployed in this fashion, so that samples could be collected for both 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. For each ISCA deployment, four chemoattractants were tested simultaneously and each was replicated four times across the ISCA. These included: (1) an equimolar mix (100 µm each) of the amino acids arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney, NSW, Australia); (2) an equimolar mix (100 µм each) of the carbohydrates arabinose, fucose, galactose, glucose and mannose (Sigma-Aldrich); (3) 100µм of ammonium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich); (4) 100 µм DMSP (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan). To avoid the generation of secondary chemical gradients, all chemoattractants for both syringe assays and ISCA deployments were diluted in 0.2µm FSW, using seawater collected from the relevant sampling environment. This FSW was also used as a control in each experiment.",1

The I value was calculated by normalising the concentration of cells responding to a given chemoattractant to the number of cells responding to the corresponding FSW control. Positive chemotaxis was identified when I was significantly (P<0.05) greater than 1. I data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and Levene*s test was used to test for homogeneity of variance. In cases where these assumptions were not met, log10 transformations were performed. To compare chemotaxis levels in the laboratory experiments, three-way analysis of variance was used (water type x chemoattractant × concentration). For the ISCA experiments, chemotactic responses within water types were compared using a paired T-test (chemoattractant), whereas a two-way analysis of variance was used to determine differences between the water types (water type × chemoattractant). A network analysis approach was employed to examine chemotactic preferences at the level of the OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units). This provided information on whether chemotactic OTUs demonstrated a specialist response, whereby they were only chemotactic to a specific chemoattractant, or a generalist response, whereby they exhibited chemotaxis towards multiple attractants. OTUs responding to the tested chemoattractants were plotted using Cytoscape 2.8.3 (www.cytoscape.org) (Shannon et al., 2003; Smoot et al., 2011; Fuhrman and Steele, 2008; Fan et al., 2012; Needham et al., 2013) according to the QIIME pipeline using the force-directed Cytoscape layout: edge-weighted spring embedded according to e-weights (Kamada and Kawai, 1989; Caporaso et al., 2010; Kuczynski et al., 2011) (Supplementary Information). Known coral-associated OTUs where identified according to Raina et al. (2010) and were colour coded to highlight their distribution among the chemoattractants. Differences in the relative abundance of motility and chemotaxis genes between the four metagenomes were identified using Fisher*s exact test with a Benjamini false discovery rate multiple test correction, within the statistical analysis of metagenomic profiles package (Parks and Beiko, 2010). All quoted q-values represent corrected values, with only values of <0.05 reported (Parks and Beiko, 2010). Confidence intervals (95%) were determined using the Newcombe-Wilson method.

This vertical distribution of cells is not due to phototaxis, but is caused by a phenomenon known as negative gravitaxis, that is, the movement of Euglena gracilis in the direction opposed to gravity (2). In fact, the distribution of algae is skewed toward the top of the channel regardless of the positioning of the LED above or below the linear landscapes, as shown in Fig. S6.

To characterize the swimming behavior at the single-cell level, we recorded trajectories of individual E. gracilis cells (Fig. S7), both in a uniform light field and within a nonuniform one. The statistics of cell motion in uniform light (Fig. S7) are in good agreement with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (5, 6):  [ ν = −γν + ση(t)*, [S1] where x is the (one-dimensional) position of the cell, v is its instantaneous velocity, and n(t) is a Gaussian white noise. The diffusive behavior observed at the population level finds confirmation by the analyses at the level of individual cells at much smaller spatial and temporal scales (Fig. S7C). In fact, a quantitative agreement between the diffusion coefficients at the two scales is observed. However, no net displacement is observable at the single-cell scale over the duration (60 s) of tracking trajec- tories recorded in nonuniform light, because the random component of the motion dominates over phototactic drift. A mathematical framework for the motion of individual cells in the presence of nonuniform light fields is proposed in the following section and is used therein to explain the impossibility to observe a net bias toward the source in the experimental trajectories at such timescales. The analysis of individual trajectories that characterizes the typical swimming behavior of cells provides information on the instantaneous speed v and the typical autocorrelation time t of swimming trajectories. This might be of interest in view of phototactic applications of microorganisms as micropropellers. Uniform light. We measured 330 trajectories of cells through dark- field microscopy, placing the recording window at the center of the microscope stage to minimize light gradients and thus bias in the direction of motion. We analyzed the recorded trajectories by computing the mean square displacement, mean square velocity, velocity autocorrelation, and velocity distribution along the direction of the channel (Fig. S7). We analyzed the x coordinates of the recorded trajectories, that is, the coordinate of each individual in the direction of the linear landscape, which was also the direction of the light gradient under the nonuniform light conditions. The statistics (Fig. S7) of cells* motion in uniform light are in good agreement with the OU process (5, 6). Specifically, the mean square displacement (Ax²(t)), mean square velocity (v²(t)),",1

Oceanogr.: Methods,Particle characterization,"To evaluate the performance and reproducibility of the porous particles, we analysed the eccentricity, equivalent radius, and microstructure. The shapes of the particles were quantified by images taken from three different angles against a dark background using a single lense reflex camera (D90, Nikon) and a 90 mm macro lens (focal ratio 2.8, Tam-ron) (Fig. 2A). The images were binarised and a pixel-connectivity algorithm was used to trace the boundary of the particle. Boundaries were approximated by ellipses, the principal axes (b, c) of which were averaged to deduce the mean eccentricity ε= √(1-(b/c)²), (8) and the equivalent hydrodynamic radius a = (b+c)/2. Image processing was done in MATLAB (MathWorks). Five sample series of nominally similar particles featured eccentricities of 0.4, equivalent to differences of the princi-pal axes of up to 10%, which was considered satisfactory conformance with the required spherical shape (Fig. 3). Particle radii varied between 6.5 mm and 14.0 mm and fell into the range of large-scale marine aggregates. The statistically significant trend of increasing sphere radius with increasing fiber radius (c = 0.98, p < 0.05, Pearson Correlation), can be associated with the larger flexural rigidity of thicker fibers. Eccentricity and equivalent radii were normally distributed and standard deviations were smaller then 1 mm, ensuring sufficient reproducibility of the process over the range of fiber radii considered. The internal structure, i.e., the porous matrix, was charac-terized by casting representative agglomerates in OCT (Sakura, Tissue Tek) before sectioning them with an HM 505E microtome (Microm), with slice thicknesses comparable to fiber radii. Images of slices were binarised and the particle cross section was determined from the areal fiber density within the interrogation window (grey shaded Fig. 2). A two-dimensional closing algorithm was used to identify the cross sectional area and the boundary was approximated by least-square fitting to an ellipse (black lines in Fig. 2D,G). Porosity was deduced from the thin slices as the ratio of fiber area to total cross sectional area. The values ranged from 0.92 to 0.96 (PES 7) and 0.93 to 0.95 (PA 43). Fibers appeared evenly distributed over the cross section with some loose fibers sticking out of the particles* boundary (Fig. 2). No predominant voids or fiber alignment in the circumferen-tial direction were observed. The internal structure was characterized by the azimu-thally averaged structure function S, the square of the modu-lus of the spatial Fourier transform of the binarised thin section image. As apparent from Fig. 4, a single characteristic pore size cannot be identified from the wave number spectra (wave numbers k were scaled by fiber radii 2af to alleviate the comparison of different fineness). However, the two dif-ferent power-law regions of the spectra can be associated with the spectral components of the pores and that of the fibers, respectively.

Purified water (Milli-Q, Millipore) was cho-sen as test liquid (Dullien 1992). The test chamber was fitted with an inlet and outlet of equal diameter and 5d in length, where the fiber sample was held in place by meshes with pore diameters of 700 μm. Laminarity of the flow was ensured by pipe Reynolds num-bers Rea = du/v well below O(1000), where u = qrd²/4. Meas-uring the pressure loss Vp = (Pin-Pout)/L over the fiber length L of the sample, the permeability was calculated from Darcy*s law (Bear 1972) -(∇p/)=-(k/µ)∇²v (9) where u is the dynamic viscosity of the test fluid. Batches PES 7, PA 22, and PA 43 were examined, spanning a wide range of fiber radii (Fig. 5). Permeability increased with increasing porosity, which is consistent with greater voidage yielding larger pores, allowing fluid flow through the porous matrix. Permeabilities were compared to a model assuming 3-D randomly packed rods by Jackson and James (1986). k/(af²)= (3/(4(1-φ)²))(1/3) (ln(1/φ)+(1.1-2φ+φ²)/(1+φ))-(11) (10) Measured values for PES 7, PA 22, and PA 43 are in good agreement with models (Eqs. 1 and 10), with deviations increasing for finer fibers and larger porosities. The devia-tions from the models can be associated with varying, fineness-dependent mechanical properties of the fibers. The finer the fiber, the lesser its flexural stiffness, and the lower the volume fraction of fibers, the more susceptible the struc-ture is to mechanical disruption and viscous forcing by the flow. Hence, internal re-organisation or re-alignment of fibers (Dullien 1992) might occur at large porosities as less robust fiber webs are prone to forming fractures or macro channels which increase permeability. The maximum perme-ability in absence of macro channels can be estimated as the permeability of a structure with the flow normal to fibers in parallel alignment (Jackson and James 1986) k/(af²)= (1/(4(1-φ)))(ln((1/φ)+1.5 +2(1-φ)-(φ²/2))) (11) which we include in Fig. 5 as the theoretical upper limit. We note that, in all cases, the permeability of the fiber particles was sufficiently small to ensure diffusion-dominated mass transfer between interstitial and ambient fluid.",1

Two 150 W halogen lamps were used for illumination from the sides of the tank. The tank was filled to a depth of 36 cm with aqueous glyc-erol mixtures (Fauth technical glycerol), where the density and viscosity were used to control Re. Two different mixtures with p = 1133kg m¯³ and 1248 kg m¯³ (v = 6.0 · 10-6m² s¯¹ and 4.1.10-4m² s¯¹ (Cheng 2008)) were used (Table 1). To avoid residual flow, the tank was left to stand for 24 h prior to measurements. Particles were centrifuged at 3000 rpm in the same fluid as in the settling column for 5 min and released into the column via a cone to avoid lateral move-ments or rotations. The centrifugation itself did not alter the radius or other particle characteristics. To measure settling velocities, particles were imaged at 10 Hz using a pco.1600 camera (PCO) fitted with a F-S Nikkor zoom lens (Nikon, f=16 to 88 mm, f#=3.5 to 22) positioned 20 cm in front of the tank. The field of view was 10 × 5 cm² and the resolution was 270 µm px¯¹. The intensity image I was normalised 1=(I-Iref)/Iref by the undisturbed background Iref. Subsequently, the largest connected white area was dissected by tracing the boundaries, where the centre of the particle was identified with the centre of gravity of an ellipse fitted to the boundary. Finally, the sinking velocity was calculated from the displacement using a five-point central difference scheme, cor-rected for wall effects (Clift et al. 2005), and averaged over ten experiments. Image processing was done in MATLAB. Settling velocities for fiber particles were in the range of 3 × 10-3 m s¯¹ to 1 × 10¯2 m s¯¹, falling into the same range as natural marine aggregates (Ploug et al. 2008). A compari-son of the settling velocities with those estimated from Eq. 5 has been shown in Fig. 6. As can be seen, the measured val-ues scatter slightly, approximately 10% above the theoretical ones. Only particles from PA 43 fibers had noticeably higher sinking velocities. Due to the relative strength of the PA 43 fibers, their surface appeared fuzzy (Figs. 2E-G, 3B). In addi-tion, they contained fewer individual, but thicker and more rigid fibers resulting in larger inhomogeneity (Fig. 2G). This level of uncertainty can mainly be attributed to deviations in size and sphericity of individual aggregates.",1

Owing to the volume requirements for completing all microfluidic experiments with a homogeneous pool of mucus, collection was carried out on each of four colonies once per day for 5 days, and mucus was stored at – 80 °C.

The device was fabricated using soft lithography techniques described previously (Weibel et al., 2007; Seymour et al., 2008), bonded to a microscope slide, and mounted onto a Nikon Ti microscope (Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were conducted at the same temperature at which the cells were grown, using a temperature controlled stage insert (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT, USA). Cell filtrate was used both as the control attractant and as the buffer in the center inlet, to create a band separating the cells and the mucus in the micro- channel (see below). Cell filtrate was obtained by passing 1.5 ml of each cell culture through a 0.2 µm syringe filter into a sterile 1.5 ml tube (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). The filtrate from each of three cultures (biological replicates) at each temperature was prepared, and then the three filtrates for a given temperature were pooled to create one homogenous filtrate for each temperature. The microfluidic devices were loaded using 23- gauge blunt-end needles (Grainger, Lake Forest, IL, USA) attached to 1 ml gastight luer tip syringes (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA) and infused from a syringe pump (PHD 2000, Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA). Three syringes were filled with cells, filtrate and attractant, respectively, and connected by Tygon tubing (0.02* ID, 0.06* OD; Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) to the three inlets of the channel. Syringe contents were flowed into the device in this order to form three adjacent, 200 µm-wide bands (Figure 1a). The flow was then stopped, resulting in the mucus chemicals diffusing across the width of the microchannel and forming a gradient in the x direction (Figure 1a). The patho- gens* behavior in response to this gradient was recorded for 165s with video microscopy directly downstream of the convergence point of the three inlets (Figure 1a). Negative control experiments were performed by replacing the coral mucus with filtrate. Syringes were washed with 70% ethanol and deionised water between experiments. Three technical replicates, using the same micro- fluidic channel, were carried out for each biological replicate. The microchannel was freshly loaded with the three bands from the three syringe reservoirs in between each technical replicate, by flushing for 1 min at 50 µl min−1 and then slowing the flow to 2 µl min−1 before beginning a new replicate run.",1

To isolate and quantify the temperature dependence of chemokinesis in V. coralliilyticus in response to mucus, we used a second microfluidic device, equipped with a small (5 mm diameter, 100 µm height) holding chamber for visualization (Figure 1b). A single device contained eight individual chambers in parallel, so that multi- ple samples could be imaged in rapid sequence, repeatedly over time, using computer-controlled motion of the microscope stage. The mucus treat- ment consisted of a 1:1 mix of cells and the same mucus pools used in the chemotaxis experiments. To allow the cells enough time to respond to the chemical environment before imaging, all treatments were incubated for 8 min in 1.5 ml sterile tubes with or without mucus at their appropriate temperature (matching cell growth temperature). Thereafter, for each biological replicate at a given temperature we loaded 20 µl of the mucus-added treatment in one chamber and 20 µl of the control in the neighboring chamber, and immediately began acquisition of a 30 s long video of each treatment at 30 frames s−1.

All videos were acquired at 30 frames s−1 to robustly capture sharp directional changes in the swimming trajectories and detect reorientations. Videos were exported in tagged image file format for analysis in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) using in- house, automated image segmentation and trajectory reconstruction software. Background subtraction and cross-correlation routines were used to detect any residual flow and to exclude non-motile cells and mucus particulates from the analysis. Individual trajectories were reconstructed from identified cell positions through subsequent frames using a particle tracking routine. Cells tracked for less than three consecutive frames were excluded from the analysis, as were trajectories with average velocity <10 µm s−1 (considered non-motile). From the reconstructed trajectories, we calculated the average swimming speed of each cell by averaging the instantaneous speed over the duration of that cell*s trajectory. The mean speed of the population, V, was quantified by averaging over all trajectories at each temperature. We tested for significant differences among swim- ming speeds in the chemokinesis experiments using a two-tailed t-test to compare the mean swimming of cells at a given temperature under the two mucus conditions (with and without). The difference in speeds between those two conditions at a given temperature were also compared with the difference in speeds observed between with and without mucus conditions in the_20 °C_experiments as a baseline.

Bacteria-diatom mixtures (20 µL of enriched bacteria mixed with 40 µL of diatom culture) were viewed in a custom-made observation chamber. The chamber consisted of a glass slide and coverslip (24 × 54 mm, no. 1 thickness) separated by rubber gasket material (1-mm thickness) along the long edges of the coverslip. The cell mixture was applied to the coverslip as a *hanging drop,* which was then set gently atop the gasket material. This setup minimized fluid motion and enhanced gas exchange with ambient air. Diatoms settled to the glass slide surface within 5-10 min; lysis and visualization were performed only on settled diatoms (Materials and Methods). In contrast to naturally occurring hotspots where lysis occurred sporadically (Fig. 1A), the controlled approach permitted capture of the full time course of the bacterial response associated with diatom lysis. Videos were captured on a Nikon TE-2000 microscope with a CMOS camera (Nikon Zyla, 2,560 x 2,160 pixels, with a region of interest set at 2,000 × 2,000 pixels) controlled through Nikon Elements software (version 5) on a desktop with RAID 0 hard drive storage.

Photobleaching was minimized by capturing fluorescent images at 15-s intervals, rather than continuously. Before imaging (e.g., for Movie S3, before the start of the movie), diatom lysis was initiated by applying blue fluorescence light (350-nm excitation, ~7 kW/m2) for 5-10 min while maintaining continual broad-spectrum LED white-light illumination (~200 µmol m−2 s−1).

Data shown here (Fig. S1) correspond to the community quantified in the prototypical single diatom example (Fig. 2). Dominance of Vibrionaceae in the enriched seawater, rather than other copiotrophic taxa, was likely influenced by the presence of highly concentrated phytoplankton and zooplankton particles, which may have been a source for attached Vibrio spp., as well as the relatively warm temperature (22 °C) of the overnight incubation (21).",1

To isolate swimming bacteria, each frame was compared against its adjacent neighbors. Large objects such as diatoms and small, slow-moving particulates are deemphasized in this approach. Individuals were identified by thresholding the resulting image and locating centroids. Subsequently, objects that were too small (approximately one pixel) or that were moving slowly by Brownian motion were rejected as noise or nonmotile. All of the positions of motile bacteria were then binned in 5-µm increments of radial distance from a point centered in the diatom. This image processing was accomplished using custom MATLAB (The MathWorks) scripts. Finally, the distributions of bacteria over time were filtered with Gaussian filters, using a 10-µm SD in the radial direction and a 2-s SD in time. The resulting smoothed distribution was normalized by the average concentration in the 3 min before lysis occurred, which matched the unaffected far-field concentration. The resulting normalized distribution, denoted B(r,t), captures the enhancement over the background concentration caused by chemotaxis in response to a diatom lysis. Image intensity time series of the diatom center were separately extracted to identify the time of lysis, corresponding to abrupt changes in the diatom phase image (Fig. 2B).

10.1073/pnas.1512307113,Chemotaxis toward phytoplankton drives organic matter partitioning among marine bacteria,"Steven Smriga,Vicente I. Fernandez,James G. Mitchell, and Roman Stocker",PNAS,Coupled DOM-Bacteria Consumption Model,"Numerical models for evaluating the distribution of diatom DOM in the presence of motile and nonmotile bacteria were implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics (version 4.2.a; COMSOL Inc.). The model in Eq. 1 (main text) was implemented using a general form PDE module with radial symmetry in a 2-mm-radius sphere. Making use of the symmetry, the mesh consisted of a line with 1,000 segments, progressing geometrically from 0.16 µm near the diatom to 8 µm at the outer boundary. The outer boundary of the model was pinned to have zero DOM concentration and the internal point had zero flux due to symmetry. The experimentally measured enhancement of motile bacteria, B(r,t), was linked to the numerical model as a MATLAB function that interpolated the spatiotemporal bacterial enhancement. Nonmotile bacteria were assumed to be uniformly distributed in the numerical model. By using the function B(r,t) measured in the absence of this second population, we assume that the behavior of motile cells is not affected by the presence of non-motile cells, and that the normalized motile cell distribution B(r,t) will not vary with the background concentration of motile bacteria yBo. This assumption may break down when overall consumption is very strong. All bacteria were excluded from the central 15-µm radius where the simulated diatom was positioned; within this region, the video data gave highly variable estimates of B(r,t) due to bacterial crowding, surface attachment, and optical interference from the diatom biomass itself. Thus, consumption was set to zero for r < 15 µm. Simulating diatom lysis, the DOM is initially evenly distributed within the diatom only but able to diffuse outward without restraint. The initial distribution has a smoothed transition to zero over 2 µm centered at the 15-µm point. Owing to the resulting transient sharp gradients, the first second was simulated in 0.01-s increments and the remaining 10 min was simulated in 30-s increments. Comsol simulations were performed using a backward differentiation formula (BDF) solver, with an intermediate setting in time stepping. The remaining parameters of the time-dependent solver remained as the default for the BDF solver. The Comsol simulations of DOM diffusion were compared against analytical solutions of spherically diffusing compounds (47) to verify that the mesh, time-stepping, and solver choices were adequate. The DOM distribution at each time step was exported, and subsequently the calculations for consumption were performed in MATLAB. The model assumes that a single chemoattractant drives the response of motile bacteria. This is a simplification, because diatoms contain and release upon lysis a broad range of chemical compounds spanning a range of diffusivities. In the absence of an ability to experimentally identify the dominant chemoattractant, and the possibility of multiple attractants stimulating the motile cells* response, we identified the effective chemoattractant diffusivity as the value of D that best corresponded to the observed bacterial response. To do this, the coupled DOM-bacteria model was tested under conditions closely replicating the laboratory experiments for a range of DOM diffusivities. Under these conditions, there were no nonmotile bacteria, and the motile bacteria had an equivalent radius (aM = 0.94 µm) and a background concentration (yB0 = 1.18 × 106 cells per mL) representing those observed in the experiments. Determination of when a simulation was a good match to the experiment was based on several metrics. First, the DOM could not escape the 2-mm-radius model geometry too quickly or remain adjacent to the diatom during the 10-min chemotactic response, because both extremes could not be reconciled with the 10-min duration of the transient clustering. Second, we evaluated the timing of the initial accumulation by comparing the DOM gradient near the diatom (15-30 µm from the diatom center) with the onset of bacteria accumulating in that same region. Third, considering the direct interaction between bacteria and DOM, we examined the length of time until the DOM gradient flattened near the diatom (as a rough measure of the duration of attraction to the diatom). Fourth, the total DOM consumed by the motile bacteria was compared for different DOM diffusivities. Although the bacterial response is not necessarily optimizing the overall amount of chemoattractant DOM consumed by the bacteria, one expects the total consumed DOM to be comparatively high at the effective diffusivity. Factoring these metrics in with our understanding of potential attractive components of diatom DOM, an effective diffusivity of 3.16 × 10−11 m2s−1 (Fig. 2D) best satisfied all four metrics, and this value was used in all subsequent analyses. This value is low relative to known, small-molecule chemoattractants (e.g., D = 9 × 10–10 m2s−1 for serine), likely because it captures the non-instantaneous release of multiple attractants with a single diffusivity value. More specifically, the diatom surface likely acted as a sieve and the release of different DOM constituents through openings in the sieve occurred at some unknown rate. Additionally, ectohydrolytic enzyme activity among clustered bacteria may have degraded large DOM molecules, leading to additional gradients of small molecules, and clustering may also reflect attraction to and consumption of these small hydrolysates. For example, diffusivity for the representative protein GFP is ~3.16 × 10−11 m2s−1 (Fig. 3C), so clustering may reflect chemotaxis toward dissolved free amino acids created by hydrolysis of similarly sized proteins released from diatoms during lysis. To quantify the consumption partitioning of different molecules released from diatoms upon lysis, and to constrain the potential for interbacterial exchange enhancement of biological entities, we used the same consumption model described above with both motile and nonmotile bacteria. However, rather than using a single effective diffusivity, D, we iterated the model for 23 assumed diffusivity values (10−13.5, 10−13.25, ..., 10−8.25 10−8 m2s−1), making it possible to calculate the quantities consumed within the phycosphere by both bacterial populations at each diffusivity. The fraction of DOM consumed by each population resulted from a combination of this local consumption and bulk consumption (discussed below).",1

Mitchell, and Roman Stocker",PNAS,Multiple Lysis Encounters,"Three phycoscape scenarios were considered: typical coastal conditions (100 diatoms per mL, 3-d population turnover time), phytoplankton bloom conditions (1,000 diatoms per mL, 3-d turnover time), and bloom collapse conditions (loss of 900 diatoms per mL per d) (SI Materials and Methods). These conditions correspond, respectively, to 1.4, 13, and 38 lyses per mL per h. To convert the lysis rates of diatoms under three ocean conditions into bacterial encounter rates, we made some assumptions. Given the brevity of the lysis response (10 min), and the spatial extent of the phycosphere (2-mm radius), it was assumed that negligible numbers of bacteria begin outside the phycosphere, enter the phycosphere during the lysis response, and differ significantly in terms of consumption from the consumption they would have had in the bulk. Therefore, an encounter occurs if a bacterium is within a phycosphere radius of a diatom when it lyses. We also assumed that diatom lysis events are uncorrelated in time and space. This is a simplification, in particular for Chaetoceros spp., because diatoms can form chains of cells that can each lyse. Finally, we assumed that independent lysis events do not have overlapping phycospheres. For the three lysis rates considered here, this is a minor assumption [at the highest lysis rate (38 events per mL per h), the expected minimum distance between lysis events within a 10-min period is ~3.2 mm, less than the phycosphere radius]. With these assumptions, we can view lysis encounters as random, independent events occurring with a constant probability at any location. Therefore, a bacterium encounters lysis events as a Poisson process with a rate determined by the occurrence of lysis in a ball of equal radius to the phycosphere, centered at the bacterium. The distributions of the number of daily encounters for bacteria in different environments are shown in Fig. S8. It is important to note that under the independent lysis assumptions there is no difference in encounter rates between motile and nonmotile bacteria. Because all locations are equally likely to be a DOM source, swimming does not change the encounter probability. The advantage of motile bacteria therefore is limited to being able to closely cluster near the DOM source within a phycosphere. In the treatment of bacteria in phycoscapes of intermittent lysis events, we shift from considering general DOM consumption to carbon consumption, which is more directly related to bacterial growth. This assumes the DOM is the sole source of carbon in the modeled environment, and that carbon uptake is proportional to DOM uptake.",1

The experimental procedure for capturing the bacterial distribution B(r,t) was tailored to evaluate the entire phycosphere and therefore does not have the resolution necessary to track individual bacteria, particularly in the dense concentrations near the diatom. As a result, it is not possible to obtain a direct estimate of the distribution in bacterial uptake determined by the changing position of each bacterium over the duration of the lysis event. Instead, we used the observed enhancement distribution of motile bacteria and a uniform distribution for nonmotile bacteria; we approximated the consumption distribution by evaluating the magnitude of consumption at a given radius, weighted by the proportion of bacteria at that radius during the chemotactic response (Fig. S12). The additional motility of individual bacteria would result in a smoothing of these distributions. Although in both cases these distributions indicate that the majority of bacteria consume very little DOM, the key distinction between the motile and nonmotile populations is apparent in the differing higher consumption tails (i.e., top 2% consumers, Fig. S12). We subsequently estimated the uptake distribution among individuals in a population after multiple phycosphere encounters. When combined with the assumed independence of lysis event encounters, the overall probability distribution of bacterial uptake over some time T can be expressed by fu\r(u|t) = ∑nfu\N(u|n)PN\T(n|t), where fu\N is the distribution of uptake for a bacterium that has interacted with N lysis events but is conditionally independent on the length of time T. PNT is the probability of encountering N lysis events over a time T, determined by a Poisson process (Fig. S8). To simplify this calculation and avoid numerical artifacts, the approximate phycosphere consumption distributions were fitted with the two-parameter gamma probability distribution (dashed lines, Fig. S12), which has a closed form for fuIN.

To isolate swimming bacteria, each frame was compared against its adjacent neighbors. Large objects such as diatoms and small, slow-moving particulates are deemphasized in this approach. Individuals were identified by thresholding the resulting image and locating centroids. Sub- sequently, objects that were too small (approximately one pixel) or that were moving slowly by Brownian motion were rejected as noise or nonmotile. All of the positions of motile bacteria were then binned in 5-µm increments of radial distance from a point centered in the diatom. This image processing was accomplished using custom MATLAB (The MathWorks) scripts. Finally, the distributions of bacteria over time were filtered with Gaussian filters, using a 10-µm SD in the radial direction and a 2-s SD in time. The resulting smoothed distribution was normalized by the average concentration in the 3 min before lysis occurred, which matched the unaffected far-field concentration. The resulting normalized distribution, denoted B(r,t), captures the enhance- ment over the background concentration caused by chemotaxis in response to a diatom lysis.

Mitchell, and Roman Stocker",PNAS,Coupled DOM-Bacteria Consumption Model,"Numerical models for evaluating the distribution of diatom DOM in the presence of motile and nonmotile bacteria were implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics (version 4.2.a; COMSOL Inc.). The model in Eq. 1 (main text) was implemented using a general form PDE module with radial symmetry in a 2-mm-radius sphere. Making use of the symmetry, the mesh consisted of a line with 1,000 segments, progressing geometrically from 0.16 µm near the diatom to 8 µm at the outer boundary. The outer boundary of the model was pinned to have zero DOM concentration and the internal point had zero flux due to symmetry.  The experimentally measured enhancement of motile bacteria, B(r,t), was linked to the numerical model as a MATLAB func- tion that interpolated the spatiotemporal bacterial enhancement. Nonmotile bacteria were assumed to be uniformly distributed in the numerical model. By using the function B(r,t) measured in the absence of this second population, we assume that the be- havior of motile cells is not affected by the presence of non- motile cells, and that the normalized motile cell distribution B(r,t) will not vary with the background concentration of motile bac- teria yBo. This assumption may break down when overall con- sumption is very strong.  All bacteria were excluded from the central 15-µm radius where the simulated diatom was positioned; within this region, the video data gave highly variable estimates of B(r,t) due to bacterial crowding, surface attachment, and optical interference from the diatom biomass itself. Thus, consumption was set to zero for r < 15 µm. Simulating diatom lysis, the DOM is initially evenly distributed within the diatom only but able to diffuse out- ward without restraint. The initial distribution has a smoothed transition to zero over 2 µm centered at the 15-µm point. Owing to the resulting transient sharp gradients, the first second was simulated in 0.01-s increments and the remaining 10 min was simulated in 30-s increments. Comsol simulations were per- formed using a backward differentiation formula (BDF) solver, with an intermediate setting in time stepping. The remaining parameters of the time-dependent solver remained as the default for the BDF solver. The Comsol simulations of DOM diffusion were compared against analytical solutions of spherically dif- fusing compounds (47) to verify that the mesh, time-stepping, and solver choices were adequate. The DOM distribution at each time step was exported, and subsequently the calculations for consumption were performed in MATLAB.  The model assumes that a single chemoattractant drives the response of motile bacteria. This is a simplification, because diatoms contain and release upon lysis a broad range of chemical compounds spanning a range of diffusivities. In the absence of an ability to experimentally identify the dominant chemoattractant, and the possibility of multiple attractants stimulating the motile cells* response, we identified the effective chemoattractant dif- fusivity as the value of D that best corresponded to the observed bacterial response. To do this, the coupled DOM-bacteria model was tested under conditions closely replicating the labo- ratory experiments for a range of DOM diffusivities. Under these conditions, there were no nonmotile bacteria, and the motile bacteria had an equivalent radius (ам = 0.94 µm) and a background concentration (yB0 = 1.18 × 10º cells per mL) rep- resenting those observed in the experiments. Determination of when a simulation was a good match to the experiment was based on several metrics. First, the DOM could not escape the 2-mm-radius model geometry too quickly or remain adjacent to the diatom during the 10-min chemotactic response, because both extremes could not be reconciled with the 10-min duration of the transient clustering. Second, we evaluated the timing of the initial accumulation by comparing the DOM gradient near the diatom (15-30 µm from the diatom center) with the onset of bacteria accumulating in that same region. Third, considering the direct interaction between bacteria and DOM, we examined the length of time until the DOM gradient flattened near the diatom (as a rough measure of the duration of attraction to the diatom). Fourth, the total DOM consumed by the motile bac- teria was compared for different DOM diffusivities. Although the bacterial response is not necessarily optimizing the overall amount of chemoattractant DOM consumed by the bacteria, one expects the total consumed DOM to be comparatively high at the effective diffusivity.  Factoring these metrics in with our understanding of potential attractive components of diatom DOM, an effective diffusivity of 3.16 × 10-11 m²s¯¹ best satisfied all four metrics, and this value was used in all subsequent analyses. This value is low relative to known, small-molecule chemoattractants (e.g., D = 9 × 10–10 m²s−1 for serine), likely because it captures the non- instantaneous release of multiple attractants with a single dif- fusivity value. More specifically, the diatom surface likely acted as a sieve and the release of different DOM constituents through openings in the sieve occurred at some unknown rate. Addi- tionally, ectohydrolytic enzyme activity among clustered bacteria may have degraded large DOM molecules, leading to additional gradients of small molecules, and clustering may also reflect attraction to and consumption of these small hydrolysates. For example, diffusivity for the representative protein GFP is ~3.16 × 10-11 m²s¯¹ (Fig. 3C), so clustering may reflect che- motaxis toward dissolved free amino acids created by hydrolysis of similarly sized proteins released from diatoms during lysis.  To quantify the consumption partitioning of different mole- cules released from diatoms upon lysis, and to constrain the potential for interbacterial exchange enhancement of biological entities, we used the same consumption model described above with both motile and nonmotile bacteria. However, rather than using a single effective diffusivity, D, we iterated the model for 23 assumed diffusivity values (10-13.5, 10-13.25, ..., 10-8.25 10-8 m²s¯¹), making it possible to calculate the quantities con- sumed within the phycosphere by both bacterial populations at each diffusivity. The fraction of DOM consumed by each pop- ulation resulted from a combination of this local consumption and bulk consumption (discussed below).",1

Mitchell, and Roman Stocker",PNAS,Bacteria Biomass and Energetics,"The uptake quantities determined by the population models (Fig. 4) were divided by a reference amount of carbon required to make an individual bacterium. Following Taylor and Stocker (36), this carbon biomass was calculated based on the cell volume (0.2-µm equivalent radius for nonmotile cells, 0.5-µm radius for motile cells) and an assumed carbon concentration of 0.1 g cm³.  For both motile and nonmotile bacteria, the bacterial growth efficiency (BGE) determines the fraction of carbon taken up that goes into biomass, with the remainder going to respiration. Al- though large ranges of BGE are quoted in the literature, we chose a moderate 20% value for BGE for both types of bacteria. Al- though we here assumed the same BGE for both populations, motile copiotrophs may actually have a higher BGE than non- motile oligotrophs, because copiotrophs generally grow faster than oligotrophs and there is evidence that BGE increases with growth rate. If this assumption is correct, then the total fraction of a diatom*s DOM transferred into bacterial biomass, and thus presumably to higher trophic levels, would be higher when robust chemotactic accumulations respond to lysis events and lower when the response is weak.  Finally, for motile bacteria, the energetic cost of swimming was translated into a carbon cost. The power required for swimming, following Taylor and Stocker (36), is Pc =cLv²/nCc, where c₁ is the effective drag coefficient for a 0.5-µm-radius bacterium (4.1 × 10-8 N s m¯¹; ref. 15), v is the swimming velocity, η is the swimming efficiency, and Cc is a conversion factor for carbon to energy. In our analysis, we assumed a range of swimming ve- locities (40-60 µm/s) and efficiencies (1–2%) and results for the envelope of conditions are given (Fig. 4). Because the cost of swimming is not drawn from the cell biomass, the model exacted the cost of swimming from the total carbon taken up (i.e., before the BGE was applied).",1

V. alginolyticus alternates between forward and backward swim-ming, in a *run-reverse-flick* motility pattern (6). Every second reorientation is a *reversal,* a change in swimming direction narrowly distributed around 180°, which results from the reversal in the direction of swimming. Every other reorientation may also be a reversal, but has a certain probability PF of instead being a *flick* (10), a change in swimming direction distributed around a mean of 90° (6). Two simultaneous criteria were used to identify reorientations, as described previously (10): (i) a high rate of change of swim-ming direction and (ii) a low instantaneous swimming speed. First, to identify changes in the swimming direction, at every time point along a trajectory we calculated the dot product of the swimming velocities before and after that point (directional co-sine). We then identified as reorientation events all local minima in the directional cosine (equivalent to local maxima in the in-stantaneous angular speed) that additionally fell below a threshold value of 0.985, corresponding to a directional change of at least 10°. Second, to identify reorientation events having a change in angle below the 10° detection threshold, we used swimming-speed in-formation, because any reorientation is expected to be accompanied by a brief reduction in swimming speed. Based on this second cri-terion, we identified all local minima in the instantaneous swimming speed that are below 50% of the mean speed of the trajectory. The absolute reorientation angle, Aθ, defined as the angle between the swimming velocities before and after a reorientation, and the reorientation frequency, f, were then quantified from all trajec-tories containing at least one reorientation (to compute Aθ) or at least two reorientations (to compute f).

The population-averaged resource exposure, NT = max CMC(V)· P(V)dV, was computed as the weighted average of the CMC values over all speed bins (with weights proportional to the number of cells in each speed bin), both with and without the chemokinetic speed enhancement (Fig. 4A).

In the model, each cell is referred to as an *agent.* In the absence of more detailed information about the molecular mechanisms of sig-naling events governing chemotaxis in V. alginolyticus, we adap-ted the model of Jackson (24). We modeled the individual agents to implement the block schemes illustrated in Fig. 5B and to proceed in one of two modes: either a *forward run* or *back-ward run,* representing in a real cell a CCW and CW rotation of the polar flagellum (as seen from behind), respectively. The agent runs in a straight trajectory in each of these modes, onto which random noise in orientation is added to mimic rota-tional diffusion (DR = 0.035 rad²/s). For simplicity, we further assumed that reorientations in between runs are instantaneous (both reversals and flicks), that reversals are perfect inversions of swimming direction (180°), and that all flicks are 90° reorientations (6). Based on these considerations, in our modification of Jackson*s model, we modeled V. alginolyticus* forward and backward swim-ming as Escherichia coli*s runs and V. alginolyticus* reorientations (either reversals or flicks) as E. coli*s tumbles. As in the study by Jackson, we set the probability that at a generic time t an agent will experience a reorientation within a time interval Δt as follows: P = At/τ where the mean run time can be expressed as follows: τ=τ exp(aPb), with dPb/dt = (1/Tm) (dPb/dt)exp and dPb/dt = (KD/(KD+C)^2) (dC/dt) where C is the chemoattractant concentration in the extracellu-lar environment, Tm is a time constant of the bacterial system (taken to be 0.1 s), το is the mean run time in the absence of concentration gradients, that is, the average unbiased run time, ac is a constant of the system (taken to be 30 s), Pb is the fraction of a cellular protein surface receptor bound by the substrate, dPb/dt is the weighted time rate of change of Pb, and KD is the half-saturation constant of the surface receptor binding to the chemoattractant (here, serine).",1
10.1073/pnas.1602307113,Speed-dependent chemotactic precision in marine bacteria,"Kwangmin Son, Filippo Menolascina, Roman Stocker",PNAS,Parameter identification,"The chemotaxis parameters for V. alginolyticus responding to serine remain unknown; therefore, we had to identify them using other approaches, described in the following. Reorientation frequency. For the reorientation frequency, f, we have direct observational data as a function of speed from our analysis. In the model, we implemented the speed-dependent reorientation frequency (Fig. 3) by fitting a phenomenological model of the following form: f(v) = (ηζ)/(1+exp((v - v₁)/ θ)) to the observations, where parameters of best fit were found to be η = -0.3942 s/μm, ζ = -0.2019 s/μm, v₁ = 18.88 μm/s, and θ = 0.8452 s/μm. Flicks. In the model, flicks are implemented as instantaneous reorientations [neglecting the ~10-ms interval between the re-versal and the flick (10)] with a reorientation angle of ±90° (with equal probability). Consistent with prior observations, flicks could occur in the model only after a backward-to-forward transition (6, 10). To determine whether an agent flicked or reversed in that case, a uniformly distributed random variable was compared with the speed-dependent probability of flick-ing PF, which is approximated by a logistic function, PF= 0.055 +0.72/[1+e^-6.25(v-36)], determined previously (10). This approach summarizes the contribution of block F to the che-motaxis pathway in Fig. 5B. Chemokinesis. Chemokinesis was implemented in the model as an instantaneous speed enhancement of 30% as a result of in-creased chemoattractant availability (Fig. S6), in line with a pre-vious mathematical model (11). Therefore, each agent has, at each time point, a speed v(x,y,t) that depends on the local con-centration of chemoattractant c(x,y) according to the follow-ing rule: v(x,y,t) = { vi*1.3 if c(x, y) ≥ ст vi if c(x,y) < ст where cr is the concentration of chemoattractant above which we observed a chemokinetic speed enhancement in our experiments (50 nM; Fig. S6), and v₁ is the speed each agent is initialized to at the beginning of the simulation (to represent the different speed bins observed experimentally). This approach reflects the exper-imental observations both in the presence and absence of a ser-ine gradient (Fig. 4A). Sensing. The parameters of the sensing model determine the dynamics of the block R (Fig. 5B). Here, our ability to determine Tm, KD, and ac is limited by the lack of information on the mo-lecular mechanism governing chemotaxis in V. alginolyticus. To overcome this limitation, we identified the values of these pa-rameters using a combination of information from the literature and parameter fitting. In particular, based on previous results for marine bacteria (25), we constrained Tm to the range 0.1-1 s and KD to the range 1-10 µM. Within these two constrains, a value of Tm (0.1 s) was chosen based on the experimentally observed run time, which is typically in the order of 0.1 s (Fig. 3), and a value of Kp (10 µM) was chosen based on a recent model of Vibrio coralliilyticus (11). After fixing these two sensing parameters, we heuristically determined the remaining parameter, ac (30 s), so as to minimize the discrepancy between the predicted CMC (Fig. S7A) and the experimentally measured CMC (Fig. 1E). Importantly, although the specific value of CMC predicted by the model depends as expected on the specific choice of pa-rameters, the predicted speed dependence of the CMC was robust to moderate changes in the parameters over realistic ranges.",1
10.1073/pnas.1602307113,Speed-dependent chemotactic precision in marine bacteria,"Kwangmin Son, Filippo Menolascina, Roman Stocker",PNAS,Simulation of the trajectories of individual agents,"With the chosen parameters, the model numerically integrated the trajectories of individual agents swimming in (i) a linear, steady chemoattrac-tant gradient, directly mimicking the microfluidic setup used in the experiments (Fig. S1); (ii) a 1D Gaussian chemoattractant field; and (iii) a 2D Gaussian chemoattractant field. For each case, 3,000 agents were initially distributed uniformly with ran-dom orientations in (i) a 600-um-wide channel for the 1D linear gradient case, with the chemoattractant field directly replicating the one established in the microfluidic setup used for experiments (from 100 to 400 nM; Fig. S1); (ii) a 3,000-um-wide channel for the 1D Gaussian case, with a maximum chemoattractant con-centration of 266 nM; and (iii) a 3,000 × 3,000-µm square domain for the 2D Gaussian case, with the same maximum chemo-attractant concentration of 266 nM. The mean and the SD were 1,500 and 450 µm, respectively, for the 1D and 2D Gaussian profiles. The initial swimming speed of each agent was chosen randomly from the range of speeds observed (Fig. 4A, cyan). Agents in the simulations did not interact with each other and they reflected in a random direction upon hitting hard boundaries on the left and right sides of the domain in the 1D simulations and on all four boundaries in the 2D simulations. Agents were con-stantly affected by rotational diffusion, responsible for a random reorientation component in the swimming trajectories (as de-scribed above). Simulation data analysis. The analysis of the simulations was done as follows. The 1D linear chemoattractant field. Trajectories were integrated for 7,000 s, a time found to be sufficient for agents to reach a steady spatial distribution, B(x) (Fig. S7B). Then the analysis followed the same steps as in the experimental data: we binned the bacterial distributions along the gradient by swimming speed, using the same upper and lower bounds of speed as in the experiments, and for each distribution B(x), we computed the CMC (Fig. S7A). In addition to in silico wild-type cells with full chemotactic func-tionality, we also simulated in silico knockout agents, for which one or more of the functions in Fig. 5B were removed in the model. Relative comparisons of the CMC values between in silico wild-type cells and in silico knockout mutants (Fig. S8B) were made using the same set of parameters identified above. All of the simulations reached steady state within 7,000 s, as for the in silico wild-type cells. From the model runs, normalized steady-state bacterial dis-tributions, B(x), and the corresponding CMC values of agents swimming at 10 different speeds (300 trajectories each) were plotted (Figs. S7A and S8B) by averaging over the last 35 s in the 7,000-s-long simulations (Fig. S7B). The population-level re-source exposure (Fig. 5C) was computed as for the experimental results (SI Text). Furthermore, in the simulations, we made di-rect comparisons between in silico wild-type cells and in silico knockout mutants based on the CMC values (Fig. S8B), which were weighted by the speed distribution P(V) to obtain a pop-ulation-level resource exposure, as NT = max CMC(V)·P(V)dV (Fig. 4). For the simulations, we further computed the accumulation time, TA(V), based on the full time course of the transient re-sponse (e.g., Fig. S7B). T₁ (V) is defined as the time taken by the CMC to reach one-half of the maximum value of the CMC of in silico wild-type cells having the same swimming speed but full chemotactic functionality (Fig. S8A). The population-averaged accumulation time, (Ta), was then computed by weighting TA (V) by the speed distribution, P(V), as (TA) = Smax TA(V).P(V)dv. The 1D and 2D Gaussian chemoattractant fields. Having obtained good agreement between the model and the experimental ob-servations (Fig. 1 C and E, and Fig. S7A) for the case of a 1D, linear chemoattractant field, we applied the model to 1D and 2D Gaussian chemoattractant fields, which more realistically cap-ture the main features of resource hotspots in marine environ-ments (22). Trajectories were integrated for 1,000 s. This timescale was chosen based on a recent study showing that the chemotactic accumulation of bacteria in the microenvironment surrounding individual phytoplankton cells enriched in dissolved organic mat-ter lasts in the order of 10-20 min (22). The CMC, used in the linear gradient case, is not applicable as a metric to quantify the magnitude of the chemotactic response in Gaussian chemical profiles. Instead, we used the chemotactic index, Ic, following previous literature (11). Ic measures the enhancement in the cell concentration within the central region of the Gaussian (a 500- μm-wide band for the 1D, Gaussian case; a 500-µm-diameter circle for the 2D Gaussian case), relative to the cell concentration outside that area, minus 1. Ic = 0 thus corresponds to a uniform cell dis-tribution (that is, no chemotaxis). The analysis then followed largely the same steps as described above for in silico wild-type cells and in silico knockout mutants. From the model runs, the Ic values of agents swimming at eight different speeds (375 trajectories each) were plotted by averag-ing over the last 100 s in each simulation and compared between in silico wild-type cells and in silico knockout mutants (Fig. S8 C and D). The population-level resource exposure (Fig. 5C) was computed by weighting the chemotactic response for each speed bin (Fig. S8 C and D) with the percentage of cells in that speed bin from the experimentally measured speed distribution P(V) (Fig. 4), as NT = Smax IC(V)·P(V)dV.",1

This was done to exploit the sodium-dependent swimming speed of V. alginolyticus, whose flagellar mo-tor is driven by sodium gradients (10).

Microchannels were fabricated using standard soft lithography techniques with a mold prepared by depositing SU-8 photoresist (MicroChem Corporation) on silicon wafers and patterning chan-nel reliefs via photolithography. The mold was silanized with tri-chloromethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich) to prevent PDMS (Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit; Dow Corning) from adhering to the master, especially between the hydrogel-trapping pillars (Fig. S1), and to ease the demolding process. PDMS prepolymer (10:1 mixture of base and curing agent of Sylgard by Dow Corning) was cured by baking at 65 °C for >1 h. PDMS microchannels were then cut and bonded to a clean glass slide via plasma treatment and incubated on a hot plate at 100 °C for 1 h. The hydrogel agarose was used at 2% (wt/vol) concentration in milliQ water to create diffusion-permeable walls between adja-cent microfluidic channels (Fig. S1). Liquid agarose was injected between arrays of trapping pillars made of PDMS through channel C (Fig. S1). Two features fabricated downstream of the inlet for the hydrogel (inlet C1)—a serpentine and a reservoir— served as visual indicators to guide the agarose injection process. Agarose was slowly injected through the inlet port C1 using a syringe pump at a constant flow rate (2–5 µL/min) and the in-jection process was continuously monitored using an inverted microscope (Nikon Ti-E microscope) by following the front of the meniscus, to ensure accurate creation of the hydrogel wall. Hydrogel injections were conducted on a temperature-controlled stage to prevent liquid agarose from solidifying too rapidly during the sequential injection of liquid agarose in the serpentine, res-ervoir, branching channels, and hydrogel walls. After completing the injection step, milliQ water was injected into channels A, B, and D before experiments to prevent trapping of air pockets in between the PDMS pillars.",1

Riffell",Journal of Experimental Biology,Fertilization assays,"In all experiments, we examined the fertilization success between individual males as the initial step towards determining the correlation between sperm chemotaxis and fertilization. Prior to fertilization experiments, gamete concentrations were quantified in a hemocytometer, and the measured concentrations were used to control sperm:egg ratios in the fertilization bioassays (Lillie, 1915; Riffell et al., 2004; Schmell, 1977). Sperm:egg ratios of 100:1, 300:1 and 1000:1 (number of eggs=1513±356; number of sperm=2×105±3.3×104 at 100:1, 7.2×105±1.6×105 at 300:1, 1.8×106±2.3×105 at 1000:1) were added to the wells of a 24-well plate (Falcon Clear Polystyrene Sterile Tissue Culture Multiwell Plate, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), yielding 8 replicates for each treatment and male at each sperm:egg ratio. To control for contact time, 1 ml of 0.5 mol 1-¹ KCl solution was added to stop sperm motility (Levitan, 2000), 3 min after exposure. This contact time yielded a consistent fertilization curve in preliminary experiments and is appropriate for L. pictus (Rosman et al., 2007). Embryos were allowed to develop for 1.5 h, after which they were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in ASW and washed twice with fresh ASW. At least 100 embryos from each replicate were scored for percentage fertilization based on the number of cells showing cleavage. A total of 18 males were used, but one male was excluded from analyses because of extremely low fertilization (<5%). Το compare male performance within each trial, relative male fertilization success was calculated as mean % eggs fertilized by male 1/mean % eggs fertilized by male 2 for each pair of males within a single trial (Tvedt et al., 2001).  Lytechinus pictus eggs contain speract, a well-studied peptide that acts as a sperm attractant (Shimomura et al., 1986; Garbers et al., 1982; Guerrero et al., 2010). Elastase (>99% purity; Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), an enzyme that cleaves at the C-terminus of the amino acids valine, glycine and leucine (Narayanan and Anwar, 1969), was utilized to selectively remove the speract (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly; Garbers et al., 1982) attractant around live eggs (Fig. 1A). Elastase was diluted to 10-7 mol 1-¹ in ASW for use in trials, and was also denatured by heating 5 ml of the diluted enzyme to boiling and used as a control for the effects of adding the enzyme material to eggs. Eggs used for enzyme assays were spawned directly into beakers containing 5×10-2 mol 1-1 Tris in ASW. Eggs from 2–4 females were pooled together in equal ratios to minimize individual female variability, and 10 ml was put into each of three 40 ml conical tubes. One tube received 0.5 ml of elastase, one tube received 0.5 ml of denatured elastase and the control tube received 0.5 ml of ASW. The eggs were incubated for 1.5 h before being used in a fertilization assay. The change in percentage fertilization between treatments was determined using a random-intercepts mixed effects model (Zuur et al., 2009), with individual males as a random effect and sperm:egg ratio and treatment as fixed effects (package Ime4; Bates et al., 2014; R Core Team, 2013). Percentage change in fertilization was calculated as: (% eggs fertilized in control condition-% eggs fertilized in treatment condition)/% eggs fertilized in control condition. Prior to testing, high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) was used to confirm that elastase digests both synthetic and egg- associated speract (Fig. 2). Egg-associated speract was prepared for this test by centrifuging eggs and desalting the resulting egg- conditioned seawater with a Sep-Pak C18 Plus Light column (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). The column was cleaned with 3 ml",1

Riffell",Journal of Experimental Biology,Microfluidics and imaging,"We designed a microfluidic device that enabled us to expose sperm from different males to the same precisely controlled chemoattractant gradient (Fig. 1C) and compare sperm behavior between males. As previously described (Ahmed and Stocker, 2008), polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) channels were designed using CAD software (Autodesk, San Rafael, CA, USA), printed onto transparency film with a high-resolution image setter (Fineline Imaging, Colorado Springs, CO, USA), and patterned onto a 4 in silicon wafer, which was spin-coated with 99 µm-thick negative photoresist (SU8-2100; Microchem, Newton, MA, USA), by exposure to ultraviolet light. The patterned channel structure had three input branch channels that met in a single *test* channel that was 4 cm long, 99 µm deep and 1020 µm wide. PDMS (Dow Corning, Midland, MI, USA) was molded against the silicon master, cured at 22°C for 24 h, peeled off of the silicon mold and cut to the size of a standard glass slide (25×75 mm). Inlets and outlets were punched into the channel using a 1 mm Harris micro-punch (Ted Pella, Redding, CA, USA) and attached to a glass slide. A covalent bond between the PDMS channel and glass slide was established by pretreating both with oxygen plasma and baking the bonded channel at 60°C for 1 h. The microfluidic device was placed on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000; Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY, USA) equipped with a 10× Nikon Plan Fluor objective. Non-toxic polyethylene tubing (BD Intramedic™™, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) was inserted into input channels and attached to 1 ml gastight syringes (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV, USA) containing ASW, sperm diluted 1000× (~1×107 to ~5×107 sperm ml¯¹) in ASW, or the attractant speract (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, USA) diluted to 1.39×10-9 mol 1¯¹ in ASW. Experiments began an average of 5 min after sperm dilution. Bubbles were removed from the syringes and tubing prior to each experiment. A syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA, USA) was used to apply a flow rate of 10 µl min¯¹ for 60 s to keep the cells and attractant stratified. Stopping the flow allowed the attractant gradient to develop by diffusion, and video recording began simultaneously. Sperm were imaged mid-depth in the channel using phase-contrast microscopy by recording sequences of 1980 frames at 33 frames s-1 with a 512x512 pixel (field of view: 8.2×8.2 mm) CCD camera (iXon Ultra 897; Andor Technology, Belfast, UK). Image analysis software (Nikon-NIS Elements; Nikon Instruments) and MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) were used to quantify sperm chemosensory behavior (detailed below). The concentration field of speract c(x,t) was obtained from the solution of the advection- diffusion equation (Ahmed et al., 2010) and verified using epifluorescence images of 10-4 mol 1-1 fluorescein (Fluka), which was used as a proxy for the attractant in the microfluidic channels. To account for the difference in diffusion coefficients between fluorescein (D=5×10-10 m² s-1; Qasaimeh et al., 2011) and speract (D=3×10−10 m² s−1; Guerrero et al., 2013), time was scaled by the ratio of their diffusion coefficients.",1

Riffell",Journal of Experimental Biology,Chemotaxis assays and analysis,"Microfluidic chemotaxis assays were performed by injecting sperm diluted 1000x into the middle input port, ASW into a side input port, and 1.39 × 10-9 mol 1-1 speract into the opposite side input port (Fig. 1C). No-speract controls were run in parallel, with ASW injected into both side input ports. After video collection, custom- written scripts in MATLAB (MathWorks) and R (R Core Team, 2013) were used to analyze the trajectories of the sperm tracks. Analyses included distribution of sperm within the channel, as well as track orientation with respect to the attractant gradient direction (0 deg). In L. pictus sea urchins, the relationship of chemokinesis and chemotaxis is unclear (Chang et al., 2013; Shiba et al., 2008). We thus conducted a preliminary analysis of sperm from 10/18 males; the results showed no evidence for speract influencing cell velocities compared with the ASW control (paired t-test, P=0.92; mean±s.e.m. for the speract treatment: 167.7± 70.7 µm s¯¹; ASW treatment: 166.5±58.7 µm s¯¹).  For sperm distribution analysis, the locations of all visible sperm were marked at 10, 30 and 60 s after stopping flow, and cells stuck to the bottom of the channel were excluded from analysis. The proportion of sperm in the attractant (or control) location at each time point was calculated by dividing the number of sperm in the attractant side (1/3) of the channel by the total number of sperm in the channel. To compare paired male performance within the same trial, the proportion of sperm in the attractant stream for male 2 was subtracted from that of male 1 (Gage et al., 2004).  For orientation analysis, the trajectories of 6-28 sperm per treatment per male were digitized and the first and last points of each track were used to determine the vector length, calculated as r= √(4x)² + (Ay)², and orientation, calculated as",1

The masters used for patterning had recessed features, which resulted in PDMS replicas with protruding features.28 To assist in removal of cured PDMS from the SU-8 masters, the latter were silanized overnight by exposure to the vapor of 1,1,2,2,-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane, CF3 (CF2)6 (CH2)2SiCl3. To cure the PDMS prepolymer, a mixture of 10:1 silicon elastomer and the curing agent was poured onto the master and held at 65 °C for 2 h. The PDMS replica was then peeled from the silicon master. Hydrophobic patterns of OTS on the glass substrate were made by using these PDMS stamps for microcontact printing (Supplementary Fig. S1). The PDMS stamp was inked with a 2 mM hexane solution of OTS and dried in air for 5 min, then placed in contact with the glass substrate at room temperature for 30 s. The stamp was carefully removed and the substrate was rinsed with 2-propanol (IPA) and DI, then dried. Because the trichlorosilane reagents are sensitive to the water content and temperature of the printing environment, the RH and the temperature of the room were kept constant at ~50-55% and ~22-24 °C, respectively.

HA452 and HA3107 were cultured at 21 *C and HA3374 at 18*C. Additional experiments were performed (1) with cells grown under a diel light cycle (14h light: 10h dark) (Extended Data Fig. 1) and (2) with monoclonal cultures of HA452. The latter were grown from a single parent cell, isolated from a prior culture by means of an inoculation loop (diameter ~100 µm) developed in house. The loop was dipped into a culture to trap a thin liquid layer and microscopy was used to select the cases with only a single HA452 in the layer. Each single trapped cell was then transferred to a separate well in a 36-well plate containing fresh growth media. Monoclonal cultures were also grown under a 14:10 light cycle (Extended Data Fig. 1c). A range of other phytoplankton species were also tested. Extended Data Table 1 summarizes the list of species, their origin, and their response to flipping.

The frame was coupled to the shaft of a stepper motor and designed to allow for full rotations from 0* to 360*. The rotation of the chamber was automated using an externally programmed controller that drove the motor, with full user control over the time series of the rotation angle. Suspensions of phytoplankton cells were gently pipetted into the chamber through one of two injection ports, which were then closed with silicone plugs. At the end of an experiment, the two ports were used to harvest cells from the top and bottom parts of the chamber using a microcapillary attached to an aspirator tube for gentle suction, for subsequent microscopic characterization. The dimension of the capillary (internal diameter = 500 µm) was chosen to avoid cell damage during sampling. During experiments, cells in the flipping chamber were visualized using a stereoscope (Nikon SMZ1000) with a plan APO ×1 objective (0.12 NA) and a digital CMOS camera (Photron FastCam SA3). The flipping chamber was mounted on a translation stage, the position of which could be controlled using micrometre screws along all three axes. The camera was focused on a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis and halfway between the two chamber walls. The depth of focus was 750 µm, ensuring that cells were more than 400 µm (>50 cell radii) from the front and back walls of the chamber, to eliminate wall effects. Any small residual wall effects that may still have occurred would have been present for the entire duration of an experiment, and thus could not have caused the population split. Images were acquired at 60 frames per second. The suspension was uniformly illuminated using a single 627 nm LED (0.1 W) mounted just outside of the flipping chamber. Neither of the two H. akashiwo strains tested showed any phototactic bias to wavelengths of light in the red spectrum, in agreement with literature 30. All experiments were conducted under diffused room light settings, to avoid possible photo-responses. For each treatment, a control experiment was performed in which cells were observed in the flipping chamber without rotation, for the same duration as the treatment. The vertical distribution of cells in these control experiments was quantified at regular intervals to ascertain that the upward bias of cells in the absence of overturning remained constant (Fig. 2a, red line, and Extended Data Fig. 8b).",1

Periodic flipping consisted of multiple, rapid overturnings of the chamber (180* in 3 s), each followed by 15 s at rest. The resulting period of 18 s corresponds to the Kolmogorov timescale τη = (ν/ε)1/2, associated with ε = 3 × 10-8 W kg-1. This value is typical of the ocean pycnocline22 and falls within the typical range of values for ocean turbulence7 (10-9–10-5 W kg-1).

After the end of every flipping experiment, we allowed the population to reach its equilibrium distribution over the vertical by waiting 30 min. This waiting time was chosen conservatively based on the observation that the concentration profile stabilizes already after ~5 min (Extended Data Fig. 7d), and the consideration that cells swimming upward at ~50 µm s-1 (Extended Data Fig. 2) cover the depth of the flipping chamber (4mm) in <2 min.",1

This is an established method18 for quantifying the reorientation timescale B, and is based on the fact that greater stability will cause faster reorientation towards the stable orientation after a cell is perturbed from it. To this end, we tracked individual cells over 15s immediately following a single flip (which provided the perturbation from the stable orientation), and averaged their rotation rate over all cells as a function of θ. Given that the smallest dimension of the field of view is along the optical axis (750 µm, the depth of field) and that cells swam on average at 75 µm s-1, an estimated residence time in the field of view is ~10 s. Tracked trajectories in our data set are as long as 22 s, with an average of 5.5 s, which is sufficient to compute the stability parameter B. The resulting data for w(θ) were well fitted with a sinusoidal function of the form Acos (θ+κ), where we imposed a phase shift κ equal to – π/2 for the top population and π/2 for the bottom population (simultaneously fitting both A and K showed consistent results for this approach). We determined the reorientation timescale from the best-fit sinusoid as B = (2A)-1 cos (π/2 + κ) (ref. 18). To account for heterogeneity in the population stability (Supplementary Information), resulting in some cells reorienting faster than others, we separately quantified B for the first 5 s and the subsequent 10s (Extended Data Fig. 7a, c). HA452 cells in the flipping chamber swam in helical patterns, characteristic of many phytoplankton species32. However, the helical component was averaged out using a 1-s moving average to reduce noise in the calculation of the stability parameter B.",1

We used phase contrast microscopy to determine the cell orientation, based on the location of the flagellum on the anterior part of the cell, and the cell contour. To assess the axial symmetry of the cell shape, we acquired images of the cross-section of ten randomly chosen HA452 cells. This was achieved by acquiring videos of each cell over tens of seconds, manually refocusing as needed to maintain the cells in focus. From each video, we identified the frames in which cells swam vertically-changing swimming plane-based on the fact that the cell boundary is in sharp focus when a cell swims vertically out of the imaging plane, but is blurry due to optical diffraction when it swims out of the imaging plane at an angle. The frame of the video in which the cell had the maximum diameter was then chosen to extract the cell*s cross-section (*top view, Extended Data Fig. 4d). Using these data, we quantified the ratio (R) between the major (bx) and minor (by) semi-axes of the ellipse",1

Of particular importance is the nucleus, because of its size and density, and we used epifluorescence microscopy to identify its size and location. The chloroplasts, having higher density than the rest of the cell, could also potentially have contributed to the location of the centre of mass, but in HA452 and HA3107 they are randomly distributed, close to the external membrane, and our analysis showed that their contribution to the offset of the centre of mass is negligible compared to the contribution of the nucleus. Chlorophyll autofluorescence imaging in HA452 cells showed that a cell typically has 15–25 chloroplasts, each 1.5 µm in diameter, in agreement with previous observations23. In the analysis, we considered 20 chloro-plasts per cell, each having a diameter of 1.5 µm and a density Pchlo = 1,150 kg m-3 (higher than the density of the rest of the cell, Pcyto = 1,050 kg m-3) (ref. 34). Chloroplasts were assumed to be distributed randomly on the interior of the cell surface, such that their outmost point was in contact with the cell surface (Extended Data Fig. 5b, c), the location where their contribution to the offset would be greatest. The contribution of the chloroplasts to the offset of the centre of mass was found to be negligible compared to the contribution of the nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 5c). Prior to imaging, the nucleus was fluorescently stained by incubating cells for 20 min in the dark with 100 nM SYTO 9 (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies), a green fluorescent nucleic acid stain (excitation/emission 485/498 nm) that stains the nucleus (Extended Data Fig. 4). The intensity of the excitation light was maintained low to prevent photo-toxicity. HA452 and HA3107 cells typically have the nucleus located off-centre. By means of image analysis, we determined the size of the nucleus as well as the distance LN = (LNa2+LNb2) 1/2 between the centre of the nucleus and the centre of buoyancy (Extended Data Fig. 4, Extended Data Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2), where LNa and LNb are the offsets along the major and minor axes, respectively. By using a nucleus density of 1,300 kg m-3 (ref. 35) and an average density for the rest of the cell of 1,050 kg m-3 (ref. 34), we then also computed the distance Lw between the centre of mass and the centre of buoyancy.",1

To model the flow around a fore-aft asymmetric cell, we solved the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations around a cell with the finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics (Burlington, MA), using the characteristic size and shape determined experi-mentally for the upward-swimming cells (see Extended Data Table 2 and Extended Data Fig. 5) and their characteristic swimming speed (75µm s-1). Imposing the torque-free condition (sum of all torques on the cell must vanish) allowed us to determine the position of the centre of hydrodynamic stress, CH. Specifically, the coordinates of CH were determined by finding the minimum of the surface integral of the cross product between the stress force and the surface of the cell.

DAF-FM Diacetate is a chemical reagent that enables the detection of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), a common reactive nitrogen species exuded by eukaryotic cells under stress38,39 (Supplementary Information). DAF-FM by itself is not fluorescent, but forms a fluorescent benzotriazole group (excitation/emission = 495/515 nm) upon reaction with the free radical NO. After incubation, cells were illuminated using cyan light (wavelength ~495 nm) and the fluorescent readout was quantified over time using epifluorescent microscopy. For each cell, the fluorescent intensity increased over time, and reached the peak value at the onset of cell lysis. The magnitude of fluores-cent intensity just before cell lysis corresponded to the maximum value of the NO accumulation in the cell. For the quantification, measurements for each cell were normalized with the value of maximum fluorescence intensity.

This was plotted against the log2 of the fraction of pAM34-carrying bacteria and linear regression carried out to determine the relationship between plasmid loss and generations. The copy number of the plasmid is equivalent to 2(intercept – log (100)), as there is no production of plasmid-negative bacteria until the mean plasmid copy number has been diluted to close to n = 1 per cell. The equation derived by linear regression was then used to back-calculate bacterial generations between the inoculum and faecal bacteria and least-squares linear regression used to calculate the maximum growth rate in vivo.",1

Levine",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,Methods,"This model captures key micro-scale dynamics occurring on particulate organic carbon (POC) in a manner scalable to the water column. For the results presented in the main text, we represent particle-associated microbial diversity using 18 groups of heterotrophic microbes, defined based on their enzyme kinetics and growth rates. Supplementary Material 2 presents a sensitivity test with a continuum of microbial classes and demonstrates that this discretization does not impact our results. We also make the simplifying assumption that each particle type consists of a single lability of organic carbon colonized by a single type of microbial primary degrader, though the conclusions of this work are not dependent on this assumption (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material 2). Here we track each unique particle type i, which is defined based on radius at formation and lability (β;). We include enzymatic degradation of polymer into low molecular weight organic matter (Cimwom), density dependent growth of the particle- associated microbial community (B₁), and the attachment (E₁₂) and detachment (L₁) of heterotrophic microbes to/from the particles. This model can be coupled to a full ecosystem model such that the generation of each particle type can be calculated prognostically. However, here we focus on the degradation of POC below the export depth and so simply include a source term to represent net particle formation above the export depth (default 100 m, see Supplementary Material 2 for simulations with alternative formation depths). For simplicity, we also do not allow for aggregation or disaggregation to occur within the water column. An extended model description is provided in Supplementary Material 1. The change in the carbon content of particle i (Cpoc,is mmol CPOC particle-1) over time is defined as: dCpoc,i/dt = -β₁B (1) where β; (mmol CPOC mmol Ccell 1 day-1) represents the polymer degradation rate of Cpoc,i by microbial group B; (mmol Ccell particle-1) similar to59. Specifically, β; captures differences in *lability* of particles, which is a function the organic carbon itself, the microbial enzymes specific to group B₁, and production rate of those enzymes by B₁. When the particle is fully consumed (Cpoc=0), the particle-associated microbial community detaches and so consumption stops. The enzymatic degradation of POC results in the production of low molecular weight organic matter (LMWOM) (Clmwom, mmol Cm-3 particle-1) which sup- ports microbial growth. We assume that there is no loss of carbon during the enzymatic cleavage from POC to LMWOM such that 1 mmol Cpoc degraded = 1",1
